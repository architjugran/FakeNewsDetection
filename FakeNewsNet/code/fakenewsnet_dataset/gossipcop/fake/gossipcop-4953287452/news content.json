After estranged family members of the future princess, 36, revealed that they weren\u2019t invited to the upcoming royal wedding, they are still making it their business to catch a glimpse of her special day.\n\nA source reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly now her half-sister Samantha Grant as well as nephew Tyler Dooley (her half-brother Thomas Markle Jr.\u2019s son) and his mother (her ex-sister-in-law), Tracy, will be flying down to London to be TV wedding correspondents.\n\n\u201cMeghan is really worried about some these members of her family,\u201d the insider says. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t spoken to them in years.\u201d\n\nTo make matters more difficult, since the actress and 33-year-old Captain General of the Royal Marines announced their engagement, Markle\u2019s family have been speaking to the press about her. \u201cShe\u2019s lost sleep over relatives who\u2019ve screwed her over,\u201d the source says. \u201cIt\u2019s the one thing she\u2019s struggled with most since meeting Harry, especially after the engagement.\u201d\n\nThe insider adds that \u201cshe\u2019s finding it really hard to trust people she meets now.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time that the Suits star\u2019s estranged relatives have commented on her relationship with the prince. After Prince Harry commented that the royals are the \u201cfamily she never had,\u201d Markle\u2019s clan hit back at his remarks.\n\nGrant also exclusively told Us Weekly a month before his comments that her regal romance has \u201ccreated rifts between\u201d the family.\n\nBut for now, as the wedding date nears, the close pal says Markle\u2019s trying to relax and avoid \u201cpaying attention\u201d to any of the family drama.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/amazon-denim-joggers-1.jpg?w=60&h=60&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/LTG-PPE-Ad-7-2020.jpg?w=900", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/uw1618_cover_ns.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-14-at-12.56.52-PM.png?w=60&h=60&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/meghan-markle-prince-harry2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1199px%2C629px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/promo-block.jpg?w=600", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/meghan-markle-prince-harry2.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CUPSHE-Womens-Shirring-Design-V-Neck-Low-Back-One-Piece-Swimsuit-1.jpg?w=60&h=60&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/meghan-markle-prince-harry2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1199px%2C629px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sophie Dweck"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/meghan-markle-has-lost-sleep-over-relatives-as-wedding-nears/", "title": "Meghan Markle Has \u2018Lost Sleep Over Relatives\u2019 As Wedding Nears", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "theme-color": "#fff", "description": "Meghan Markle has family matter issues to take care of as her royal wedding to Prince Harry nears \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Meghan Markle Has \u2018Lost Sleep Over Relatives\u2019 As Wedding Nears", "description": "Meghan Markle has family matter issues to take care of as her royal wedding to Prince Harry nears \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/meghan-markle-has-lost-sleep-over-relatives-as-wedding-nears/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-03-28T14:16:01+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/meghan-markle-prince-harry2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1199px%2C629px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/meghan-markle-prince-harry2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1199px%2C629px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Video", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-03-28T14:00:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-28T14:16:01+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Meghan Markle has family matter issues to take care of as her royal wedding to Prince Harry nears \u2014 get the details", "title": "Meghan Markle Has \u2018Lost Sleep Over Relatives\u2019 As Wedding Nears", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/meghan-markle-prince-harry2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1199px%2C629px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522245642.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}

Apparently, the one who stole her heart is Ed Skrein, but is he interested in her as well?\n\n\u2018Angie thinks Ed is hot and she loves working with him. Obviously, he is a great actor, but she is also looking forward to chatting with him behind the cameras. She would love to get to know Ed and find out what makes him tick,\u2019 one source claims.\n\nIt is safe to say we\u2019re totally shipping this pair!\n\nNot only is Ed super cute and relented, but he is also a self-professed \u2018family man\u2019 and Angie had quite the big family!\n\nWhile Jolie is the mother of six children, Ed is also the father of one.\n\nHe has a seven-year-old son and if they got together, they\u2019d have a super adorable blended family.\n\nThe insider also states that Jolie had a lot to do with Ed getting the Maleficent role he is playing.\n\nAllegedly, she was able to see his talent \u2018from a mile away.\u2019\n\nUnfortunately, it sounds like he is not only a great actor but is also a very professional one so he\u2019d rather not hang out with his co-stars.\n\n\u2018After premiere events or parties, some of the stars are like, \u2018Let\u2019s go out,\u2019 but I just go back to the hotel room. I\u2019m the most boring person!\u2019 he revealed during an interview.\n\nOf course, that doesn\u2019t mean Angelina will not be the one to get him out of his shell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBesides, \u2018If word gets out about her flirting with Ed, it will drive Brad nuts!\u2019 Win-win for her, right?", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ed-skrein-angelina-jolie.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/amber-heard-bollywoodtrendz-blogspot-com-300x225.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/kandi-burruss8217-new-8216speak-on-it8217-episode-is-out-and-addresses-another-issue-involving-todd-tucker8217s-daughter-kaela-82-300x216.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/maxresdefault-1-3-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%202000%201125%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/john-legend-theboombox-com_-300x200.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/porsha-williams-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/colin-jost-ew-com_-300x200.jpeg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2060%2060%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2042%2042%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/angelina-jolie-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/NickMarkus-1-60x60.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%2035%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/angelina-jolie-zahara-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/moore-brooklyn-300x158.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/courtney-stodden-has-no-time-for-f-boys-300x220.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/brad-pitt-and-angelina-jolie-700x466.jpeg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%2027%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Traci-Braxton-700x466.jpg"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ed-skrein-angelina-jolie.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nick Markus", "Delores Perry", "Angie Williamson", "Angela Williamson"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/reports-claim-angelina-jolie-is-crushing-on-maleficent-2-co-star-ed-skrein-is-he-interested-142612/", "title": "Reports Claim Angelina Jolie Is Crushing On \u2018Maleficent 2\u2019 Co-Star Ed Skrein \u2013 Is He Interested?", "meta_data": {"author": "Nick Markus", "news_keywords": "angelina jolie, Ed Skrein, Maleficent", "keywords": "celebrity news, angelina jolie, Ed Skrein, Maleficent", "p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "theme-color": "#dedede", "description": "According to new reports, Angelina Jolie has been crushing on one of her co-stars on the set of the Maleficent sequel!

She married the sexiest bachelor alive, and she intends to protect him from any potential honey trap.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the Oscar-winning actor wants to cheat, he will find a way to do it, Amal and her unattractive nannies can not stop him.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Barack-Obama-Michelle-Obama-New-York-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jimmy-fallon-returns-to-the-studio-for-the-tonight-show-but-with-major-changes-300x210.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/maxresdefault-1-3-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/melaniat-trump-face-mask-300x214.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amal-and-George-Clooney-Together--700x466.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2060%2060%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2042%2042%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Amal-Clooney-George-Clooney-Ugly-Nannies.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/George-Clooney-700x466.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%2035%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/George-Clooney-Matthew-McConaughey-Other-Celebs-Promised-As-A-List-Guests-In-Event-That-Was-Built-On-Lies-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/DylanFisher-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/moore-brooklyn-300x158.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/courtney-stodden-has-no-time-for-f-boys-300x220.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201000%20699%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5da8286b584674e0067f8b2976f0b45f?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1bbc0f239e26307a0d93b94f48156aab?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/counting-on-did-jill-duggar-accidentally-reveal-shes-pregnant-with-baby-number-three-in-her-latest-instagram-post_-300x210.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/donald-trump-2-300x200.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%2027%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/kandi-burruss8217-new-8216speak-on-it8217-episode-is-out-and-addresses-another-issue-involving-todd-tucker8217s-daughter-kaela-82-300x216.jpg"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Amal-Clooney-George-Clooney-Ugly-Nannies.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dylan Fisher", "Angie Williamson", "Angela Williamson"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/amal-clooney-wants-to-hire-ugly-nannies-for-twins-so-george-can-avoid-cheating-24561/", "title": "Amal Clooney Wants To Hire Ugly Nannies For Twins \u2013 So George Can Avoid Cheating", "meta_data": {"author": "Dylan Fisher", "news_keywords": "amal clooney, george clooney", "keywords": "celebrity news, amal clooney, george clooney", "p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "theme-color": "#dedede", "description": "Amal Clooney is pregnant with twins who are due in June and with the help of husband, George, they are actively looking for nannies -

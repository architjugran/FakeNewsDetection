According to a report from Radar Online, the duo has been feuding over Ryan\u2019s flirtation with his award-winning costar.\n\nRELATED: Ryan Gosling Goes on \u2018Ellen\u2019 to Tease First Picture of New Daughter!\n\nThe 36-year-old father has been denying all accusations of cheating, though. \u201cRyan keeps insisting that there\u2019s nothing going on with Emma,\u201d an insider told Radar. \u201cHe is hoping that another baby will make Eva see how committed he is to her.\u201d\n\nEva, who shares daughters Esmeralda, 2, and Amada, 9 months, with Ryan is reportedly \u201cfed up\u201d with their current situation. \u201cShe feels like Ryan has turned her into a baby-making machine!\u201d\n\nRELATED: See the Best Looks From the 2017 Golden Globe After Party!\n\nAmidst all the drama, Ryan did take the time to thank his long-time partner in his Golden Globe acceptance speech. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to be up here without standing on the shoulders of a mountain of people and there\u2019s no time to thank everyone,\u201d the heartthrob said. \u201cI just would like to try to thank one person properly and say that while I was singing and dancing and playing piano and having one of the best experiences I\u2019ve ever had on a film, my lady was raising our daughter, pregnant with our second and trying to help her brother fight his battle with cancer\u2026So, sweetheart, thank you.\u201d\n\nThough reports surfaced of a possible secret wedding for the famous parents back in September of 2016, the duo has yet to make any announcement of nuptials.\n\nWe\u2019re hoping their long-term relationship, which blossomed back in 2011, isn\u2019t cut short. But, being the private couple that they, we\u2019re not sure we\u2019ll ever know!", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Jamie-and-Doug-Season-1-MAFS.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C750px%2C750px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Farrah-Abraham-Says-Her-Upcoming-Shows-Will-Be-Culturally-Diverse.jpg?crop=47px%2C0px%2C1835px%2C1040px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ryan-gosling-eva-mendes.jpg?w=1180&h=460&crop=1", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Aaron-Hernandez-Jailhouse-Lover-Claims-He-Was-Guilty-of-Double-Murder.jpg?crop=66px%2C0px%2C1534px%2C869px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Duggar-Girls-Wearing-Pants-and-Jeans.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ryan-gosling-eva-mendes-emma-stone.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/When-Does-Ridiculousness-Come-Back-Chanel-West-Coast-Reveals.jpg?crop=0px%2C44px%2C2151px%2C1219px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ryan-gosling-eva-mendes-emma-stone.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Meghan-Markle-Hated-Royal-Dress-Code-Shes-Much-More-Comfortable-Wearing-Casual-Clothes.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/naya-rivera-denim-outfit.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3271px%2C1852px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Farrah-Abraham-Says-Sophia-Craves-Getting-Know-Her-Dad-Family.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IT2319_cover_cn3_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Farrah-Abraham-Would-Be-Open-to-Reuniting-With-Her-Fellow-Teen-Mom-Stars.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ryan-gosling-emma-stone.jpg?w=1180&h=450&crop=1", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Who-Are-Kobe-Bryants-Wife-and-Kids.jpg?crop=0px%2C69px%2C3150px%2C3150px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chanel-West-Coasts-Calls-Costars-Rob-Dyrdek-and-Sterling-Steelo-Brim-Family.jpg?crop=0px%2C8px%2C1976px%2C1119px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/REELZ-Profiles-Olivia-Newton-John-Health-Crisis-in-Tell-All-Special-01.jpg?crop=246px%2C0px%2C1522px%2C861px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-27-at-4.09.35-PM.png?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Lost-Resort-cast-2.jpg?resize=120%2C68"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ryan-gosling-eva-mendes-emma-stone.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jeryl Lippe"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/ryan-gosling-emma-stone-flirting-eva-mendes-fight-124454/", "title": "Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone\u2019s Flirting Leaves Eva Mendes \u201cFed Up\u201d (REPORT)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "There is trouble in paradise!

He looks to be lying down with his eyes, closed, and the cover reads, \u201cGeorge Michael THE LAST PHOTO!\u201d It also says \u201cPop Icon\u2019s Suicide Note Found.\u201d The problem is that this isn\u2019t actually how the photo was taken. Our cousin site Gossip Cop, who has been busting bad dish for years writes, \u201cThis is a blatant manipulation. In actuality, the publication took a grainy, previously published paparazzi photo of Michael and rotated it 45 degrees. As a result, it appears as if Michael is laying dead, when in reality, he was upright at a dinner party when the picture was taken.\u201d\n\nGossip Cop notes that \u201d The National Enquirer doesn\u2019t explicitly say it is a \u2018death photo,\u2019 but that certainly seems to be the implication by the way it is abnormally featured.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the \u201csuicide note\u201d mentioned on the cover isn\u2019t actually a suicide note at all. Instead, the tabloid put together \u201cwords from a series of interviews\u201d that he gave long before he died. Within the article, the magazine admits that the photo was taken two months before he died, which Gossip Cop says is \u201clikely only done to remove liability and prevent the outlet from getting sued.\u201d\n\n[image: The National Enquirer]\n\nHave a tip we should know?

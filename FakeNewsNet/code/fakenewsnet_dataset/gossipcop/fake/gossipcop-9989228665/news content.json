That is not her style. But Ben\u2019s insensitive actions have changed her. She could never really trust Ben. He is no longer hiding his relationship with girlfriend Lindsay, and Jen has hit a breaking point.\u201d\n\nAccording to Star, Garner has turned to the Church of Scientology for help.\n\nThe famous actress has been feeling tired, going through sleepless nights, and is hoping that Tom Cruise\u2019s controversial church will help her get back on her feet.\n\nGarner is allegedly doing therapy and trying other alternative techniques that can help her mental state and physical well-being.\n\nA person on her team claimed that the story is not true and that Garner regularly attends the Community United Methodist Church.\n\nThis is not the first time, Garner has been linked to Church of Scientology.\n\nAndrew Morton, author of Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography, claimed in 2004, Garner and an extensive list of Hollywood stunners were contacted by the action movie star to be his wife.\n\nMorton wrote: \u201cCruise left messages on the Alias star\u2019s voice mail in 2004 asking \u201cif she knew what freedom was,\u201d but his advances were rebuffed .. Katie Holmes accepted the offer and signed a contract to commit to Scientology and that her father brokered a high-paying prenup.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is conceivable that after a major breakup, Garner is looking for answers where she can find them.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/demi-lovato-reminisces-about-playing-naya-riveras-girlfriend-on-glee-calls-the-late-actress-an-inspiring-latina-300x210.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jimmy-fallon-returns-to-the-studio-for-the-tonight-show-but-with-major-changes-300x210.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/maxresdefault-1-3-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/melaniat-trump-face-mask-300x214.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/kandi-burruss-husband-todd-tucker-300x274.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ben-affleck-Jennifer-Aniston-and-Ana-de-Armas-700x466.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2060%2060%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Blake-Shelton-Gwen-Stefani-Christmas-Engagement-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Ben-Affleck-Ana-De-Armas-700x466.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2042%2042%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Mel-Walker-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ana-de-armas-and-ben-affleck-twinning-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%2035%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/moore-brooklyn-300x158.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/courtney-stodden-has-no-time-for-f-boys-300x220.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Ben-Affleck-Jennifer-Garner-Scientology.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201855%20972%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%2027%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/kandi-burruss8217-new-8216speak-on-it8217-episode-is-out-and-addresses-another-issue-involving-todd-tucker8217s-daughter-kaela-82-300x216.jpg"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Ben-Affleck-Jennifer-Garner-Scientology.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mel Walker", "Angie Williamson", "Angela Williamson"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/ben-affleck-divorce-reportedly-pushed-jennifer-garner-to-join-the-church-of-scientology-her-team-denies-it-55740/", "title": "Ben Affleck Divorce Reportedly Pushed Jennifer Garner To Join The Church Of Scientology \u2013 Her Team Denies It", "meta_data": {"author": "Mel Walker", "news_keywords": "ben affleck, jennifer garner", "keywords": "celebrity news, ben affleck, jennifer garner", "p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "theme-color": "#dedede", "description": "Ben Affleck has apparently pushed Jennifer Garner to seek refuge in the Church of Scientology.

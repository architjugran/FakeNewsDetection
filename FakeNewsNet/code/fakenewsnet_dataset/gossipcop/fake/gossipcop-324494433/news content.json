If you look at their first statement it says divorce, not separate,\u201d a source told the magazine. \u201cThey just did it the way they wanted to and did what was best for their kids. There was no catalyst, it was just time. Nothing has changed, they are and still will be putting their kids first.\u201d\n\nThe divorce could be made final within the year, so until then let\u2019s raise a toast to Bennifer 2.0 and their love story. It\u2019s the end of an era.", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1887969784608635&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://amp.assets.huffpost.com/assets-1123f83be23039b1d729cd5de964f5e0/images/snapchat/huffpost-in.png", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f0d7c60220000dc09386f1e.jpeg?ops=150_150", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f0d764a250000cb09c29b09.png?cache=GsNto4BNEK&ops=150_150", "https://amp.assets.huffpost.com/assets-1123f83be23039b1d729cd5de964f5e0/images/logos/HuffPost-left.svg", "https://amp.assets.huffpost.com/assets-1123f83be23039b1d729cd5de964f5e0/images/logos/HuffPost.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f0c38912700002b09e66a9f.jpeg?ops=150_150", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f0773a22500005707c297ef.jpeg?cache=q8DwHwooBn&ops=150_150", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f0d58d2250000e909c29aee.jpeg?cache=3kpFcMBA6k&ops=150_150", "https://amp.assets.huffpost.com/assets-1123f83be23039b1d729cd5de964f5e0/images/icons/newsletter-toaster.png", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f0c35d2600004500c45b07.jpeg?cache=fnZr7zJFKi&ops=1200_630", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f0861ae2200002a07386c46.jpeg?ops=150_150", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=india&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f0c78fb1f00005909337f58.jpeg?ops=150_150", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f0d6c00220000dc09386f10.jpeg?ops=150_150", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f0d53421f00007f0a337fdc.jpeg?cache=fN8pCXnYiX&ops=150_150", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f0c97402500009b09c29a8a.jpeg?cache=sdgnLfFW78&ops=150_150"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f0c35d2600004500c45b07.jpeg?cache=fnZr7zJFKi&ops=1200_630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cole Delbyck", "Huffpost Us", "Entertainment Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jennifer-garner-and-ben-affleck-file-for-divorce_n_58f0bf56e4b0da2ff85fdbe5", "title": "Ben Affleck & Jennifer Garner File For Divorce Amid Reconciliation Rumors", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=1000", "description": "It's the end of an era.", "og": {"type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f0c35d2600004500c45b07.jpeg?cache=fnZr7zJFKi&ops=1200_630", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f0c35d2600004500c45b07.jpeg?cache=fnZr7zJFKi&ops=1200_630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "site_name": "HuffPost India", "title": "Bennifer 2.0 Put Us Out Of Our Misery And File For Divorce", "description": "It's the end of an era.", "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jennifer-garner-and-ben-affleck-file-for-divorce_n_58f0bf56e4b0da2ff85fdbe5", "app_id": 146076648752549, "locale": "en_IN"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146076648752549, "pages": 146076648752549}, "twitter": {"site": "HuffPostIndia", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Bennifer 2.0 Put Us Out Of Our Misery And File For Divorce", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f0c35d2600004500c45b07.jpeg?cache=fnZr7zJFKi&ops=1200_630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "description": "It's the end of an era.", "creator": "@cdelbyck"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,max-snippet:-1,max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "keywords": "Celebrities,divorce,Celebrity Couples,Ben Affleck,jennifer garner", "article": {"section": "Entertainment", "tag": "Celebrities,divorce,Celebrity Couples,Ben Affleck,jennifer garner", "published_time": "2017-04-14T19:18:09+05:30", "modified_time": "2017-04-14T19:18:09+05:30"}, "can-recommend": "true", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffingtonpost.in", "locale": "en-in", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=306621789, app-argument=huffpostnews://?entryID=us_58f0bf56e4b0da2ff85fdbe5", "taboola.category": "entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1492177689.0, "source": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}

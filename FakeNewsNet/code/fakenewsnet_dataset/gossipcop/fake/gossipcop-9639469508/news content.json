Coffee Bean Wednesday, and had a friendly embrace with the hot mystery blonde.\n\nIt's unclear if this was a romantic hookup, or purely platonic ... but, fact is, a lot of people in Hollywood are anxiously waiting for Chris to get back on the dating scene after last year's split from Anna Faris.\n\nWe know Anna's moved on with cinematographer Michael Barrett -- he's even met her parents.",

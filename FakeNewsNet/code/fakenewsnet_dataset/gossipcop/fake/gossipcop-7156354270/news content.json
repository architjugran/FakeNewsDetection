As a Hollywood star who has walked many red carpets and sat down for countless interviews, she's used to that give-and-take relationship with the media that celebrities have. It was a balance that Diana also had to learn how to handle, especially as she and Charles both began to tell their respective sides of the story in their ugly divorce battle.\n\nRight now, it's that understanding of the power of celebrity that is helping Meghan navigate her new role to her full advantage. There is no doubt that Meghan and Harry are the current superstars of the royal family, so much so that some of the press pack covering William and Kate's official tour of Scandinavia earlier this month ended up leaving the future King and Queen to fly back to Britain to report on a Meghan and Harry appearance instead. The Cambridges might be closer to the throne but right now Harry and Meghan have bigger star power (don't feel too sorry for William and Kate, this is likely a welcome relief after years of being hounded by the newspapers).\n\nAnd yet Harry, as fifth (soon to be sixth) in line to the throne, has more freedom than his older brother, and that also extends to Meghan. The couple, while never able to fully avoid inquiring minds, will always be less scrutinized than William and Kate.", "images": ["https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2018120/rs_600x600-180220174918-600-meghan-markle-princess-diana.jpg?fit=around|1080:1080&output-quality=90&crop=1080:1080;center,top"], "top_img": "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2018120/rs_600x600-180220174918-600-meghan-markle-princess-diana.jpg?fit=around|1080:1080&output-quality=90&crop=1080:1080;center,top", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.eonline.com/news/915159/countdown-to-the-royal-wedding-why-meghan-markle-could-become-the-next-princess-diana", "title": "Countdown to the Royal Wedding: Why Meghan Markle Could Become the Next Princess Diana", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "google-site-verification": "jOadQCDbZTkKw5sn27yXszjIb9c3PdMPHENN92uPWy8", "msvalidate.01": "564B986CE3CECCAE84779191BEC6B755", "fb": {"admins": 10101649, "pages": 1387539234854280, "app_id": 195662528604}, "og": {"title": "Countdown to the Royal Wedding: Why Meghan Markle Could Become the Next Princess Diana - E!

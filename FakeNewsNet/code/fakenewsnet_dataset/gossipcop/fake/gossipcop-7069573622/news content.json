Ouch!\n\nAfter causing everyone who still believed in true love to shudder collectively after hearing that the two of them were breaking up, Brad Pitt, 53, and Angelina Jolie, 42, still don\u2019t seem to be on the friendliest of terms after their split. A source close to Brad told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that Brad doesn\u2019t think a long-lasting love is in the cards for Angelina. \u201cBrad is doubtful Angelina can have a successful marriage after theirs failed. Brad knows first hand how incredibly unique and challenging it is being in Angelina\u2019s family. Brad gave it everything he had and is disappointed they could not stay together,\u201d our source says.\n\nBrad is currently rumored to be dating actress Ella Purnell, 21, but he still has a lot of respect for his ex. The source went on to say, \u201cIt is difficult dealing with the media, the fame, career, traveling and everything else that goes with being one of the most powerful women in Hollywood. Brad knows what a dedicated mother Angelina is and how hard that can be for even the strongest men to deal with in a relationship.\u201d\n\nWe reported earlier about how Angelina invited Brad to go trick-or-treating with their kids, but that Brad wasn\u2019t \u201chaving it\u201d with the prospect of any hangout with his ex. Our source added, \u201cBrad understands that the best, most healthy and lasting relationships need lots of compromise so whoever has a shot at marrying Angelina will need to give up a lot to fit into her challenging lifestyle. Brad feels that while he wishes her the best, after several failed marriages for Angelina, the right guy for her might not exist.\u201d While you muse on whether true love exists or not, check out pics of the celebrity couples who had downright painful breakups.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Angelina will eventually find love again?", "images": ["https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/the-db-method-review.gif?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/kelly-rowland-felt-overshadowed-by-beyonce-ap-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/swat-fall-premiere-season-4.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/tim_mcgovern.jpg?w=48", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-ftr.jpg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/palm-springs-watch-hulu.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://i1.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-26-at-6.04.30-PM.png?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/quarantine-makes-me-realize-just-how-important-my-mom-friends-are.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/padma_bikini-90-minute-workout-that-tones-her-abs-splashnews-ftr-2.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/halle-berry-celebrates-20th-xmen-anniversary-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tim Mcgovern", "Sabrina Rojas Weiss", "Nikki Brown", "Dave Nemetz", "Tim Chan", "Tom Brueggemann", "Weekend Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/11/02/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-new-marriage-not-successful/", "title": "Brad Pitt \u2018Doubtful\u2019 Angelina Jolie Can \u2018Have A Successful 4th Marriage\u2019 After Theirs Failed", "meta_data": {"description": "According to a source close to Brad Pitt, the actor doubts whether or not Angelina Jolie can have a successful fourth marriage.", "news_keywords": "Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Brad Pitt \u2018Doubtful\u2019 Angelina Jolie Can \u2018Have A Successful 4th Marriage\u2019 After Theirs Failed", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/11/02/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-new-marriage-not-successful/", "description": "Brad Pitt may be finding love again, but a source close to him EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com that the actor doubts the \u2018right guy\u2019 exists for Angelina Jolie.

She told us, \u2018If they can\u2019t eat, I can\u2019t eat.' The only thing her frightening weight loss is calling attention to is her health, not the unfortunate people she\u2019s trying to help. Brad\u2019s trying desperately to make Angie understand the dire straits she\u2019s in.\n\nWell, Jolie\u2019s frightening weight loss is certainly getting the National Enquirer\u2019s attention a lot recently.\n\nThey\u2019ve run two stories about it in the past couple of weeks alone.\n\nShockingly Skeletal Angelina Jolie Wraps Herself In Shroud!\n\nAnd, Angelina Jolie Anorexia Crisis\u2014Down to 79Lbs!\n\nIn the latter they claim:\n\nAngelina Jolie is a walking skeleton who could drop dead at any moment! As the wispy star\u2019s weight plummets to a tear-inducing all-time low of 79 pounds, The National ENQUIRER can reveal that her friends fear she\u2019s losing a brave battle \u2014 and is in danger of suffering severe organ failure and possibly death! Her heartbroken husband Brad Pitt is anxiously trying to get Angie, 40, to eat more and work less, but his desperate pleas have fallen on deaf ears!\n\nWell, on a plus note, at least she has that \u201cshroud\u201d she wrapped herself up in when she went out to dinner.\n\nThat will definitely come in handy for when she finally loses her \u201cbrave battle.\u201d\n\nShit-storing Tom Cruise:\n\nIn a wondrously insane story, US Weekly claims that Tom Cruise is leaving pooh all over his trailer on the set of the movie he\u2019s currently filming.\n\nApparently, Cruise engages in a bizarre anti-aging treatment that involves him having his stool samples analyzed by doctors.\n\nHe allegedly keeps his shit in tupperware containers that he stores in his winnebago.\n\nThey quote a tom cruise and his pooh insider:\n\nAn assistant collects the samples for testing. They can only be picked up after he\u2019s left the Winnebago.\n\nAwesome.\n\nSo, which one wins?\n\nThe angelina jolie syrian refugee hunger strike or shit-storing tom cruise?\n\nYou decide\u2014vote in our poll now!\n\nFor more entertainment, music and pop culture updates and news, follow Max Page on Twitter\n\nThe Angelina Jolie Syrian refugee hunger strike or shit-storing Tom Cruise\u2014vote now!\n\n<a href=\"https://polldaddy.com/poll/9409271/\"></a>\n\nMadonna Drunk Dialing \u2018Everyone\u2019 Wins Best Fake Story Award\n\nEllen Staging An Intervention For Justin Bieber Wins Fake Story Award\n\nPrince Harry Desperate To Find A U.S. Wife Wins Best Fake Story Award\n\nPrevious Next Previous Next Hey world, it's Angelina.

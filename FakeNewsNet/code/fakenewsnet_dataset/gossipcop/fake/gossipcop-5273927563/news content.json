The denim designer reportedly doesn\u2019t want to be an unwed mother, and according to a Radar source, she doesn\u2019t even want to make the announcement until there\u2019s a ring on her finger.\n\n\u201cKhlo\u00e9 is pushing her man for a ring harder than ever before now,\u201d said the insider. \u201cAt this point, she is practically begging him to propose. She does not want to be just his girlfriend when this baby is born and she wants him to do it stat!\u201d Khlo\u00e9 has not yet publicly admitted that she\u2019s expecting, but since her alleged due date is in February, she doesn\u2019t have long before the cat is out of the bag. Tristan better hurry up!\n\nKhlo\u00e9 hasn\u2019t been shy about wanting to marry Tristan, even as far back as April (which is when she is reported to have conceived the baby.\u201d When asked if she would accept a proposal from Tristan in ES magazine, she enthusiastically said \u201cYes, I would.\u201d She also gushed about him, saying she had \u201cnever been in this kind of love before.\u201d Furthermore, she hinted about having kids, which in hindsight should have tipped us off that she was about to get pregnant (or was already.)\n\n\u201cI would love to have a family. We\u2019ve talked about it,\u201d she admitted. \u201cHe is a father, and I know for a fact that he would be an impeccable father.\u201d Tristan\u2019s ex-girlfriend Jordan Craig gave birth to his child in December 2016, after he and Khlo\u00e9 started dating. So, you can see why she wants to lock him down officially before the baby comes. No one wants to be just another random baby mama! It sounds like they\u2019re both on the same page and want to spend their future together, so Tristan should just bite the bullet already and pop the question!", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Jamie-and-Doug-Season-1-MAFS.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C750px%2C750px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Farrah-Abraham-Says-Her-Upcoming-Shows-Will-Be-Culturally-Diverse.jpg?crop=47px%2C0px%2C1835px%2C1040px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Aaron-Hernandez-Jailhouse-Lover-Claims-He-Was-Guilty-of-Double-Murder.jpg?crop=66px%2C0px%2C1534px%2C869px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Duggar-Girls-Wearing-Pants-and-Jeans.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/When-Does-Ridiculousness-Come-Back-Chanel-West-Coast-Reveals.jpg?crop=0px%2C44px%2C2151px%2C1219px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/scott-disick-lamar-odom.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Meghan-Markle-Hated-Royal-Dress-Code-Shes-Much-More-Comfortable-Wearing-Casual-Clothes.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/naya-rivera-denim-outfit.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3271px%2C1852px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Farrah-Abraham-Says-Sophia-Craves-Getting-Know-Her-Dad-Family.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/lamar-odom-new-girlfriend.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IT2319_cover_cn3_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kris-jenner-monetize-grnadkids.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Farrah-Abraham-Would-Be-Open-to-Reuniting-With-Her-Fellow-Teen-Mom-Stars.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Who-Are-Kobe-Bryants-Wife-and-Kids.jpg?crop=0px%2C69px%2C3150px%2C3150px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chanel-West-Coasts-Calls-Costars-Rob-Dyrdek-and-Sterling-Steelo-Brim-Family.jpg?crop=0px%2C8px%2C1976px%2C1119px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/REELZ-Profiles-Olivia-Newton-John-Health-Crisis-in-Tell-All-Special-01.jpg?crop=246px%2C0px%2C1522px%2C861px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-27-at-4.09.35-PM.png?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Lost-Resort-cast-2.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson.png?resize=1060%2C630"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson.png?resize=1060%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emy Lacroix"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson-engaged-144470/", "title": "Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian Wants Tristan Thompson Engagement Before Announcing Pregnancy", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "It's a race against the clock for Tristan Thompson to propose to Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian!

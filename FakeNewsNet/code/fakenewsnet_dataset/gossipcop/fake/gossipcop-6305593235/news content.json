They are now in a better place than they have been in a long time and should be settling their divorce and custody agreement by sometime in February.\u201d\n\nThe former couple announced their divorce in late 2016. It was claimed that Jolie pulled the split trigger after Pitt got into an argument with Maddox.\n\nHowever, a source told Us Weekly that Pitt is an excellent father who is dedicated to his little clan.\n\nThe person in the know shared: \u201clike to spend more time with them than he does, when he is with his children, his children, he prefers to keep things very private and safe. He wants to protect the kids as much as possible and not open them up to public scrutiny.\u201d\n\nAccording to another insider, Pitt disagrees with Jolie on how to raise their children, and it drew them apart.\n\nThe family friend had the following to say: \u201cBrad and Angelina have been at war over how to raise and educate their many children. Angelina keeps dragging the kids to red carpets, award shows, and extravagant trips around the world while Brad has been doing the complete opposite. While Angelina treats the children like her best friends and takes them on dates to her award show appearances, Brad has been trying to instill in his children the wholesome, humble, midwest values he grew up learning.\u201d\n\nThe individual concluded by: \u201cEvery time Brad sees another picture in the press of Angelina and the kids, he quietly fumes while and he doubles his energy to provide the children with a quiet, peaceful, normal life.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFans are hoping the pair will work things out away from the media.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Angelina-Jolie-Brad-Pitt-Custody.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/demi-lovato-reminisces-about-playing-naya-riveras-girlfriend-on-glee-calls-the-late-actress-an-inspiring-latina-300x210.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/brad-pitt-and-alia-shawkat-engaged-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jimmy-fallon-returns-to-the-studio-for-the-tonight-show-but-with-major-changes-300x210.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/maxresdefault-1-3-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/melaniat-trump-face-mask-300x214.jpeg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/26ff38530c7e19a8c7b03994e3593c5e?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2060%2060%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2042%2042%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Mel-Walker-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/angelina-jolie-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/David-Copperfield-New-York-Post.com_-700x466.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%202000%201330%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%2035%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/angelina-jolie-zahara-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/moore-brooklyn-300x158.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/courtney-stodden-has-no-time-for-f-boys-300x220.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/counting-on-did-jill-duggar-accidentally-reveal-shes-pregnant-with-baby-number-three-in-her-latest-instagram-post_-300x210.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%2027%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/kandi-burruss8217-new-8216speak-on-it8217-episode-is-out-and-addresses-another-issue-involving-todd-tucker8217s-daughter-kaela-82-300x216.jpg"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Angelina-Jolie-Brad-Pitt-Custody.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mel Walker", "Angie Williamson", "Angela Williamson"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/brad-pitt-is-heading-to-court-next-month-for-custody-agreement-with-angelina-jolie-108447/", "title": "Brad Pitt Is Heading To Court Next Month For Custody Agreement With Angelina Jolie", "meta_data": {"author": "Mel Walker", "news_keywords": "angelina jolie, brad pitt", "keywords": "celebrity news, angelina jolie, brad pitt", "p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "theme-color": "#dedede", "description": "An end to the custody war between Angelina Jolie and her estranged husband, Brad Pitt, is reportedly near.

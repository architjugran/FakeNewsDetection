For comparison, Forbes estimates that Jenner's older sister Kim Kardashian is worth roughly $350 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 20-year-old's net worth has skyrocketed beyond that of her siblings thanks to the success of Kylie Cosmetics. Forbes conservatively values the company at $800 million, with an estimated $330 million in sales in 2017. Jenner is both the face of the company and the sole owner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForbes' Natalie Robehmed details how Kylie Cosmetics has found success both by harnessing Jenner's immense social media following and slashing costs by outsourcing labor. There are only five full-time employees, with Jenner's mother, Kris, handling finances and PR in exchange for a 10% management cut. Kylie Cosmetics is currently dealing with slowing growth. Forbes reports that revenue grew just 7% in 2017, with lip-kit revenue dropping an estimated 35%.\n\nHowever, it would take more than a slow year of sales to stop Jenner from reaching billionaire status and making history.\n\n\"Another year of growth will make her the youngest self-made billionaire ever, male or female, trumping Mark Zuckerberg, who became a billionaire at age 23,\" Robehmed reports.", "images": ["http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=9900186&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://static-ssl.businessinsider.com/image/5b460de069e6c937008b4633-1200/kylie jenner style evolution23.jpg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/thumb/msid-60085318,width-65,height-47/default-thumb.jpg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/photo/50740876/downarrow.jpg", "https://www.businessinsider.in/photo/64950251/kylie-jenner-is-on-the-cusp-of-becoming-the-worlds-youngest-self-made-billionaire-with-forbes-estimating-her-net-worth-to-be-3-times-as-large-as-kim-kardashians.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=13194393&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://www.businessinsider.com/thumb/msid-60085318,width-100,height-70/default-thumb.jpg", "https://static-ssl.businessinsider.com/image/5b460bbd7b67141e008b464c-1004/screen shot 2018-07-11 at 95214 am.png"], "top_img": "https://www.businessinsider.in/photo/64950251/kylie-jenner-is-on-the-cusp-of-becoming-the-worlds-youngest-self-made-billionaire-with-forbes-estimating-her-net-worth-to-be-3-times-as-large-as-kim-kardashians.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://www.businessinsider.com/kylie-jenner-richer-than-kim-kardashian-report-2018-7", "title": "Kylie Jenner is on the cusp of becoming the world's youngest self-made billionaire, with Forbes estimating her net worth to be 3 times as large as Kim Kardashian's", "meta_data": {"description": "Forbes MagazineKylie Jenner is on the cover of Forbes' America's Women Billionaires issue.Kylie Jenner is on the cover of Forbes' \"America's Women Billionaires\"", "keywords": "thewire,thelife,retail", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@BiIndia", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.in/kylie-jenner-is-on-the-cusp-of-becoming-the-worlds-youngest-self-made-billionaire-with-forbes-estimating-her-net-worth-to-be-3-times-as-large-as-kim-kardashians/articleshow/64950251.cms", "title": "Kylie Jenner is on the cusp of becoming the world's youngest self-made billionaire, with Forbes estimating her net worth to be 3 times as large as Kim Kardashian's", "description": "Forbes MagazineKylie Jenner is on the cover of Forbes' America's Women Billionaires issue.Kylie Jenner is on the cover of Forbes' \"America's Women Billionaires\"", "image": "https://www.businessinsider.in/photo/64950251/kylie-jenner-is-on-the-cusp-of-becoming-the-worlds-youngest-self-made-billionaire-with-forbes-estimating-her-net-worth-to-be-3-times-as-large-as-kim-kardashians.jpg"}, "news_keywords": "retail,thewire,thelife", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "type": "article", "title": "Kylie Jenner is on the cusp of becoming the world's youngest self-made billionaire, with Forbes estimating her net worth to be 3 times as large as Kim Kardashian's", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.in/kylie-jenner-is-on-the-cusp-of-becoming-the-worlds-youngest-self-made-billionaire-with-forbes-estimating-her-net-worth-to-be-3-times-as-large-as-kim-kardashians/articleshow/64950251.cms", "image": "https://www.businessinsider.in/photo/64950251/kylie-jenner-is-on-the-cusp-of-becoming-the-worlds-youngest-self-made-billionaire-with-forbes-estimating-her-net-worth-to-be-3-times-as-large-as-kim-kardashians.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 645465345465774, "admins": 556964827}, "website": "https://www.businessinsider.in", "robots": "NOODP", "google-site-verification": "NpZv5Qfl0TuFiebbwMualP_h2a3QtmQGFjE9hhw9um8", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}

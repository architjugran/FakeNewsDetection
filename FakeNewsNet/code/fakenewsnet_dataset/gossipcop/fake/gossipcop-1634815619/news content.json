And you know what? They don\u2019t even realize what is happening to them. They are so corrupted, they can\u2019t even see what is right in front of their eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst they had the drought that lasted years and years, killing off billions and billions of dollars in crops, and making the soil so incredibly dry that a large rainstorm could easily turn into a major flood.\n\n\u201cThen they had the fires. Awful, awful fires. Historical, deadly fires. Thousands lost their homes, scores lost their lives and their livelihoods. Did you know the Thomas fire is still burning? In the winter!\u201c\n\n\u201cAnd now they just had dozens of homes destroyed by mudslides,\u201d Tennessee-born Parton said, making reference to the mudslides that have killed 15 people, with the toll expected to climb above 30. The mudslide hit an affluent part of California, and damaged Oprah Winfrey\u2019s house.\n\n\u201cWhen they get hit with the \u2018Big One\u2018, Parton said, referencing the popular name for the super quake expected to rock California in the future, \u201cthen we will know that the End Times have truly begun.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t forget the sexual abuse scandals rocking Hollywood. They are being punished for embracing Satan and rejecting God.\u201d\n\nIs California suffering from bad weather and bad luck, or is Parton right? Could a vengeful God be punishing California for decades of vice and sin?\n\nParton, who has sold more than 100 million records worldwide and been nominated for two Academy Awards, has previously stated that she considers herself an entertainer, and doesn\u2019t believe it is her role to get involved with politics.\n\nAt last year\u2019s Emmys, Parton was joined onstage by Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda to present an award. Tomlin and Fonda took the opportunity to criticize President Donald Trump, but Parton refused to join in, maintaining a dignified silence.", "images": ["https://p0.ipstatp.com/large/005a58c66b250193f63b", "https://p9.pstatp.com/list/300x196/pgc-image/40c30c4f348c4989a02769d4dc602e25.jpg", "https://p9.pstatp.com/list/300x196/pgc-image/9c01e52d4cdd4282bdf007a99118389a.jpg", "https://p9.pstatp.com/list/300x196/pgc-image/a2b4ff60db4242d881b6859856e0f595.jpg", "https://p9.pstatp.com/list/300x196/39fe000480c49094402b.jpg", "https://p9.pstatp.com/list/300x196/pgc-image/RvUR6bb2JlJ4Xk.jpg", "http://www.twoeggz.com/res/images/logo.png", "https://p9.pstatp.com/list/300x196/pgc-image/2458dc1778bb4cfc95e4828abaa3b03c.jpg", "https://p9.pstatp.com/list/300x196/pgc-image/c1e7e0f8114b45ceb205cf93eedaec0e.jpg", "https://p9.pstatp.com/list/300x196/pgc-image/9a1da7e9bace432ab4b3b528a80ab72d.jpg", "https://p9.pstatp.com/list/300x196/pgc-image/RvWXfNqAmwiA7J.jpg", "https://p9.pstatp.com/list/300x196/pgc-image/c971ec26b7b04a17a13f08b1d54cb15b.jpg", "http://www.twoeggz.com/pic/int/2018-01-13/e60e0212015a98e687bd23cc169c2e9c.jpg"], "top_img": "http://www.twoeggz.com/pic/int/2018-01-13/e60e0212015a98e687bd23cc169c2e9c.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "Dolly Parton: California\u2019s \u2018Biblical Disasters\u2019 Punishment For \u2018Embracing Satan\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Dolly Parton: California\u2019s \u2018Biblical Disasters\u2019 Punishment For \u2018Embracing Satan\u2019", "description": "California is \u201cthe darkest state in the Union,\u201d according to country singer Dolly Parton, who claims that the state has been hit with a series of \u201cBiblical disa", "image": "/pic/int/2018-01-13/e60e0212015a98e687bd23cc169c2e9c.jpg"}, "keywords": "Dolly,Parton:,California\u2019s,\u2018Biblical,Disasters\u2019,Punishment,For,\u2018Embracing,Satan\u2019", "description": "California is \u201cthe darkest state in the Union,\u201d according to country singer Dolly Parton, who claims that the state has been hit with a series of \u201cBiblical disa"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.twoeggz.com", "summary": ""}

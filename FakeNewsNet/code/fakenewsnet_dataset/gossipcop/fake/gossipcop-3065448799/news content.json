That\u2019s the untruthful claim coming from one of this week\u2019s tabloids. Gossip Cop can debunk the allegation with video proof.\n\nThe new cover of OK! Australia features the teaser, \u201cJen\u2019s Heartbreaking Interview: \u2018I\u2019m Not Ready To Divorce Ben.'\u201d Inside the issue, the same alleged quote appears in the headline, with the magazine claiming Garner \u201creveal[ed] why she hasn\u2019t finalized their split.\u201d The outlet is referring to Garner\u2019s recent interview with the CBS show \u201cSunday Morning,\u201d which broadcast a nine-minute profile of the actress this past Sunday.\n\nDuring the segment, she spoke candidly about the difficulty of living under tabloid scrutiny during her relationship with Affleck, and in the wake of their 2015 breakup. \u201cThere was a solid decade where there was five or six cars minimum, and easily up to 15 or 20 on the weekends, outside of my house at all times. And looking back on that, I really feel the stress of it. I could cry talking about it,\u201d Garner said.\n\nShe went on, \u201cWhat I think I learned is that scrutiny on your private life puts a pressure to make something happen. You feel a pressure to hurry up and get married because you think that will end the, \u2018Are they engaged or are they not?\u2019 And that\u2019s true in the reverse as well. If there is any inkling of trouble, or if the tabloid decides there\u2019s trouble, it can create trouble. But to be honest, public scrutiny \u2014 everyone says, \u2018Oh, you\u2019ve had to go through this in public.\u2019 The public isn\u2019t what\u2019s hard. What\u2019s hard is going through it.\u201d\n\nThe outlet features some of these quotes in its article, but adds in the line, \u201cI\u2019m not ready to divorce Ben.\u201d As the full CBS video of Garner\u2019s interview shows, she never uttered such a quote, nor did she ever say anything remotely similar. This is an indisputable fabrication.\n\nThe publication also claims that, though the actress and Affleck split three years ago, she \u201cadmits that even now, it\u2019s hard to let go.\u201d Again, the footage shows Garner said nothing like that. The \u201cstress\u201d to which she referred was entirely about the paparazzi staking out her home throughout the marriage, and \u201clooking back on that,\u201d as she said, can make her emotional. The tabloid maintains Garner \u201copened up about struggling to cope with the breakdown\u201d of the relationship when that\u2019s clearly not the case. She also never \u201crevealed\u201d why they haven\u2019t finalized the divorce.\n\nOn top of those blatant falsehoods, the magazine also quotes an \u201cinside source,\u201d who accuses Garner of \u201cstalling\u201d the divorce, and claims she\u2019s \u201cterrified\u201d of losing Affleck to his girlfriend, Lindsay Shookus, amid \u201crumors\u201d that the \u201cSNL\u201d producer \u201ccould be pregnant.\u201d These \u201csource\u201d quotes, however, are plagiarized from the National Enquirer and RadarOnline, which Gossip Cop busted more than a week ago for wrongly contending Garner was \u201cblocking\u201d Affleck and Shookus from having a wedding. Even though those outlets were inaccurate in their allegations, OK! doesn\u2019t bother to provide attribution and instead passes off the quotes as their own.\n\nSimilarly, the article ends this way: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that Ben will be a tough act to follow. \u2018He\u2019s the love of my life,\u2019 she sadly admits. \u2018What am I going to do about that?'\u201d Again the tabloid doesn\u2019t credit the original publication, likely because these quotes are two years old and from Garner\u2019s first post-split interview with Vanity Fair in 2016. But they\u2019re presented here as current statements, as if they may be from Garner\u2019s CBS profile, when they are unequivocally not.\n\nConclusion: The cover of OK! and the headline of its article feature the quote, \u201cI\u2019m Not Ready To Divorce Ben.\u201d But the full video of Garner\u2019s interview with CBS News, which is what the story is about, shows she never said that. The tabloid also doesn\u2019t provide any context for additional quotes from Garner, presenting them as recent comments when they\u2019re actually from an interview that was conducted a few years ago with a separate publication. In addition, the magazine plagiarizes from two fellow gossip outlets. This transparent fact-check makes it evident that the story is full of lies and misinformation.", "images": ["http://www.cardcow.com/values/images/352378184276.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Mhze4oLHuco/Wu71VLLlWgI/AAAAAAAAFv8/Qvq1-o1-qGoCBY7KGuQoo1er5zLrcGyvgCLcBGAs/s640/Vanviz%2BFt%2BTommy%2BVocal%2BX%2BMirah%2B-%2BSIRI%2BRmx.jpg", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/storage5.magcloud.com/image/bdf4c380c6e35d47bca0c82a4859ddd5.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZgPw_pWfZ_A/UK6v5O8_63I/AAAAAAAAPL4/okJJn0_HP3M/s200/poster.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-o3EKVx-l0yY/Vo-WOnFn4XI/AAAAAAAAGws/BiM-EbscGYw/s400/beautiful%2BBabie.jpg", "http://shareae.com/uploads/posts/2013-11/1384985022_00000.jpg", "http://garner315.rssing.com/favicon.ico", "http://www.zeckhausen.com/images/wheels/bbs_18inch.jpg", "http://images.allsingaporestuff.com/styles/big_within_article/s3/field/image/jump_off_hdb_crush_damage_mercedes_benz_singapore_suicide_1.jpg?itok=HkH4iuA9", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZPTCx1qdnQY/W2E6yeDYgDI/AAAAAAAAJYE/GBAuRJ7TCmIT58KE289sfozqnKOZA97kACLcBGAs/s200/IMG_20180731_155842.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XqF_0flLgpY/XVuX1hbUvbI/AAAAAAAAasQ/torDemb8n3UTqMzKARpvaM59V19aI2p5wCLcBGAs/s1600/14-15.PNG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F7Npfcm-7k8/W1F2vbHA0wI/AAAAAAAAjqU/JWDBNn5TJiwNKfPNkG7T2gHb-EniEMXmACLcBGAs/s400/IJB%2BHeli%2BMaint.25-03-04.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6EfmS74DIyE/UwPeZpoxemI/AAAAAAABVf4/SZhXjpvIGrI/s1600/IMG_9644.jpg", "http://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/800x/17521/image.jpg", "http://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B6AQcZaiKz8PUWRJZF85X2JXZ0U&export=download", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n4UguIIfGdg/WwVu6glZjqI/AAAAAAAAgCo/rw4ENvjYvgg1QtVjIq0G3gzf1QIHvQ8igCLcBGAs/s1600/sandani_fernando_4.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5dzPjUUuo3o/UOq1O7FhN4I/AAAAAAAAan4/FWI6U4EA7bc/s400/IMG_0167.jpg", "http://zapt2.staticworld.net/images/article/2012/10/windows_8_-100010033-gallery.jpg", "http://www.rssing.com/inc2/img/tsbtn.png", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-znDmd7By6cY/WN3dNXx-5nI/AAAAAAAADVU/Uey2gUZaAKMJ1ADedI2icvRZARQKRLn7gCLcB/s1600/Wazifa%2BSurah%2BFil.jpg", "http://www.rssing.com/inc2/img/matult.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/sCTixU1.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-KygWsHah2_7Qa.gif", "http://puu.sh/nM6vt/dfc9e60379.jpg"], "top_img": "http://garner315.rssing.com/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "Jennifer Garner \u2013 Gossip Cop", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://garner315.rssing.com", "summary": ""}

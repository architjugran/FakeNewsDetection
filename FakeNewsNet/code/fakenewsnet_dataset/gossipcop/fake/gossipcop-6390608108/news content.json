The American Idol reboot is in jeopardy of being canceled because ratings aren\u2019t exactly what the network had hoped for. A source exclusively told In Touch, \u201cMany believe it has to do with the sexual misconduct allegations against Ryan Seacrest.\u201d\n\nRyan has vehemently denied the accusations against him made by a former stylist who claimed that he would grind his erect penis against her while in his underwear, groped her, and slapped her buttocks. He has since been cleared by NBC, yet his reputation still seems to be a bit tarnished.\n\nAnd Ryan is not the only one contributing to the show\u2019s questionable future. Celebrity judge Katy Perry \u2014 who was paid $25 million for the gig \u2014 has also been a big factor as \u201cher flirty behavior with contestants is a turnoff and key element of the ratings decline.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cFirework\u201d singer recently planted a smooch on the hopeful contestant, Benjamin Glaze, who had never been kissed before. The source said that particular kiss, \u201cwas met with disapproval.\u201d He publicly spoke about the incident with The New York Times and said, \u201cI was a tad bit uncomfortable. I wanted to save it for my first relationship. I wanted it to be special.\u201d Aside from the Katy drama, the source revealed that the other two judges \u2014 Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan \u2014 are just \u201cbland.\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s in store for the singing competition? The source said, \u201cThere are already whispers of a cancellation or a shake-up in the judging panel. Everyone is panicking because the rebooted Idol just isn\u2019t the lightning-rod hit ABC thought it would be.\u201d The reboot premiered on March 11 and lost 3 million viewers by March 19.", "images": ["https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/katy-perry-ai-contestant-prank.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/american-idol-panic-mode.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cardi-B-Flaunts-Curves-and-Leaves-Little-to-the-Imagination-in-See-Through-Outfit-featured.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C2000px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Do-Pimple-Patches-Actually-Work-Dr-Will.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C5602px%2C3173px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nickerdiles_66492253_536685667071942_8783495222015764651_n.jpg?crop=0px%2C136px%2C1080px%2C612px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/american-idol-panic-mode.png?w=1180&h=590&crop=1", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chase-Chrisley-New-Girlfriend-Emily-Medders-1.jpg?crop=25px%2C404px%2C977px%2C553px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/american-idol-reboot-ryan-seacrest.png?w=1180&h=704&crop=1", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/is-ryan-seacrest-leaving-american-idol.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/american-idol-2018-layla-spring.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/thenikkibella_84078405_2731228150290245_7074942051047440765_n.jpg?crop=0px%2C68px%2C818px%2C817px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_editorial_10441309bc.jpg?crop=0px%2C75px%2C3150px%2C1787px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Lost-Resort-cast-2.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/The-Bachelor-Meet-the-Women_PP.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Naya-Rivera-and-Son-Josey.jpg?crop=0px%2C401px%2C2912px%2C1650px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/True-Thompson-Cutest-Photos-Feature.jpg?crop=51px%2C35px%2C1896px%2C1897px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/american-idol-panic-mode.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Khloe-Kardashian-Gives-a-Little-Tour-of-True-Thompson-Sweet-Bedroom-01.jpg?crop=149px%2C47px%2C701px%2C702px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Scott-Disick-Sofia-Richie-Back-Together-Exclusive.jpg?crop=140px%2C140px%2C2140px%2C1212px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/LS2319_cover_ns4_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Savannah-Chrisley.jpg?crop=0px%2C21px%2C1500px%2C849px&resize=120%2C68"], "top_img": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/american-idol-panic-mode.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alex Riccardi"], "canonical_link": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/american-idol-canceled-157091/", "title": "The American Idol Reboot Is in Jeopardy of Being Canceled", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "The show might not go on after all!

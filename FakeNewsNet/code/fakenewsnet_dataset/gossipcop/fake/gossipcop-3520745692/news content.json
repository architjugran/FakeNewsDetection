She has been so relieved to get her body back after the last year, so she is not ready to go through it all again so soon after giving birth to Stormi,\u201d a source close to Kylie tellsEXCLUSIVELY.\n\nWe previously learned that it was a big deal for Kylie to get her pre-baby body back as quickly as possible after giving birth, so we\u2019re not surprised to hear how shocked she was upon the scare. But that also doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not open to having more kids with Travis. \u201cKylie wants a lot of kids, but was far from prepared for it to happen again right away.

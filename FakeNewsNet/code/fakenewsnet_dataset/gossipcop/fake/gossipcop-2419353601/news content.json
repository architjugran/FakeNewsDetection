You see what looks like a bump ... thing is ... we did some digging and it was apparently shot at a Golden Globes party they attended 11 months ago.\n\nKylie hadn't even started seeing her baby daddy-to-be, Travis Scott until April ... which is around the time we know she got pregnant.", "images": ["https://imagez.tmz.com/image/09/16by9/2017/12/26/09e6683715e55b6397ffb926adaba14f_xs.png",

{"url": "dlisted.com/tag/justin_theroux/page/2/", "text": "I\u2019m still getting over the PTSD of scanning through Instagram yesterday and see how half of Hollywood was at Jennifer Aniston \u2019s 50 th birthday celebration. Not since Taylor Swift \u2019s squad era has there been such a case of \u201cHow da FUQ are these people all friends?\u201d Jen even made me shed a tear of petty pride after she went from \u201c debating \u201d inviting her ex-husband, Brad Pitt , to her birthday to actually having him there \u2013 all while he is in the middle of a nasty-ass divorce from Angelina Jolie ! Don\u2019t fret, Angelina, maybe y\u2019all can ex-boo thang swap because Justin Theroux wasn\u2019t at Jen\u2019s party\u2026even though he wished her a happy birthday yesterday.\n\nEven though the media loves a good ol\u2019 Poor, Sad Jen narrative, Jennifer Aniston is saying not to cry for her again . Jennifer Aniston doesn\u2019t care if you think she\u2019s struck out 0-2 on her marriages, because that\u2019s not the way she sees it.\n\nJustin Theroux has been linked to so many people since his split from Jennifer Aniston. If there was an unofficial Justin Theroux Rebound Bingo game, someone would have at least four corners and a line by now. Most recently though, he declined to comment on whether he was with Emma Stone or Selena Gomez or Petra Collins by telling the New York Times: \u201cIs this the part where I coyly raise an eyebrow and not answer the question?\u201d\n\nHe might not be saying who he\u2019s coyly raising any of his body parts around, but we can once again look at the clues and wildly speculate. People points out that 47-year-old Justin was spotted yesterday in Paris, France with Spider-Man: Homecoming actress, 28-year-old Laura Harrier.\n\nJustin Theroux Steps Out with Spider-Man Actress Laura Harrier in Paris https://t.co/EjUMA9idvc \u2014 People (@people) October 2, 2018\n\nBefore you go thinking: \u201cCome on, plenty of guys in their late-40s wander aimlessly around the romantic streets of Paris in Autumn with their late-20s female friends,\u201d this isn\u2019t new. Justin and Laura were rumored to be casually hanging out in France earlier this summer. At the time, Laura denied anything was going on by telling Elle: \u201cWe all work together for [Louis Vuitton] and have become friends.\u201d Reps for Justin and Laura declined People\u2019s request for a comment, so we don\u2019t know for sure.\n\nBut if they are dating, then I wish them the best, especially Laura. Normally an almost 20-year age difference would cause the older person to struggle to relate to the younger person. But Justin prides himself on being that hipster that knows everything before everyone else, so this might be the first time the younger person feels out of touch. \u201cOh my god, you don\u2019t know what reverse-pecan water is?? That\u2019s so cute.\u201d\n\nPic: Wenn.com", "images": ["https://26uepavkh8yx35d834o3oay1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/dlisted_44/img/dlisted.png", "https://26uepavkh8yx35d834o3oay1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wenn33864561.jpg", "https://26uepavkh8yx35d834o3oay1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/wenn32046586.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-ejSXfyZMwcbnr.gif", "https://26uepavkh8yx35d834o3oay1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/anistoninstyle2018.jpg", "https://26uepavkh8yx35d834o3oay1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/dlisted_44/img/dlistedbw.png", "http://dlisted.com/favicon.ico?v=1", "https://26uepavkh8yx35d834o3oay1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/wenn35344415.jpg", "https://26uepavkh8yx35d834o3oay1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wenn32046578.jpg", "https://26uepavkh8yx35d834o3oay1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ElleCoverAniston-1.jpg"], "top_img": "http://dlisted.com/favicon.ico?v=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["J Harvey", "Michael K"], "canonical_link": "https://dlisted.com/tag/justin_theroux/", "title": "Be Very Afraid", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "wtgaXQuvduR_ynbFXYU1BBBEM-yaIh4zid2J5aq9r5Q", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Dlisted", "title": "Justin Theroux", "url": "https://dlisted.com/tag/justin_theroux/", "type": "article", "description": "Justin Theroux"}, "fb": {"app_id": 662132140485214}, "description": "Dlisted | Be Very Afraid | Page 2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://dlisted.com", "summary": ""}

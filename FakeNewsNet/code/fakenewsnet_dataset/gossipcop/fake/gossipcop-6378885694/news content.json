Lisa Marie, her rep said in a statement, was \"entirely heartbroken, inconsolable and beyond devastated but trying to stay strong for her 11-year-old twins [Harper and Finley Lockwood] and her oldest daughter, Riley [Keough, 31].\"\n\nDespite coming from such a famous family, Benjamin has long stayed under the radar, only occasionally popping up on his mother's social media posts and attending public events with his relatives. But now new information and details about the young man \u2014 who bore a striking resemblance to his famous grandfather \u2014 have emerged on The Underground Bunker, a blog run by Scientology expert and critic Tony Ortega.\n\nRELATED: Stars we lost in 2020\n\nOrtega explained in a July 13 post that many of his readers had reached out to ask if Benjamin had been, like other members of his family, a member of the Church of Scientology. Ortega reports that Benjamin had indeed \u2014 like his mother, father and actress older sister, Riley \u2014 been raised in the controversial religion that also counts stars like Tom Cruise, John Travolta, Kirstie Alley, Danny Masterson and others among its ranks and stars like Leah Remini and filmmaker Paul Haggis among its defectors.\n\nThe Underground Bunker previously reported that Lisa Marie left Scientology in 2014 and pulled her family out. However, the blog also claims that Riley returned to the religion and that Priscilla previously said through representatives that she had not left the church, which The Underground Bunker disputes. It remains unclear if Lisa Marie has returned. According to Ortega, her ex-husband Danny remains a member.\n\nAccording to The Underground Bunker, whose post about Benjamin was picked up by Page Six and other outlets, Ben was still a member in 2013, which is when he completed the faith's \"Purification Rundown.\" However, a source close to the Presley family who'd known Ben since childhood told the blog that in recent years, the 27-year-old \"was definitely out of Scientology and badmouthed it to his friends.\" In May, the source told The Underground Bunker, \"Ben had been talking about how f\u2014ed up kids get in Scientology.\"\n\nRELATED: Elvis Presley's family: Where are they now?\n\nThis same source further told The Underground Bunker that Ben had struggled with alcohol and drugs. According to the source, Ben had \"recently been in rehab\" battling his addictions, Ortega wrote, explaining that it was not a Scientology treatment program.\n\nBen had been staying at his mother's home in Calabasas, the source further explained. The Underground Bunker reports that this is where Ben died and that Lisa Marie was not home at the time. On July 13, DailyMail.com reported that a neighbor heard people partying at the property at 1 a.m. and at 3:30 heard a woman screaming. Another neighbor told DailyMail.com that Los Angeles Sheriff's Department deputies arrived at the property around 6 a.m.\n\nAccording to another source who spoke to The Underground Bunker, as far as the Presley family's faith was concerned, \"The important thing is that the entire family was shaped by Scientology, and it's paying the price because of it.\"\n\nRELATED: Stars with their look-alike kids\n\nThat source explained that Ben's death, and the manner in which he died, will be incredibly overwhelming for Lisa Marie, who herself has been open about her struggles with addiction in recent years. \"Ben was her baby. More than Riley. More than the twins,\" the second source told Ortega. \"This will be beyond inconceivable for her. I really worry that it might be too much for her.\"", "images": ["https://www.wonderwall.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/07/tom-hiddleston-zawe-ashton.jpg?w=1000",

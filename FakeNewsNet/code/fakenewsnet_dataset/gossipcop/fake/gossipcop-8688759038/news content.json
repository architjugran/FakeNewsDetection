F\u2013king, f\u2013king crap!\u201d\n\nMezger\u2019s attorney, Pete Slevin, denied that it was his client heard in the recording.\n\n\u201cMoreover, the recording was apparently dated May 26, 2017, and hence does not reflect any statement \u2018amid\u2019 the so-called legal battle,\u201d Slevin said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to putting on sworn testimony tomorrow that completely contradicts the assertions.\u201d\n\nThe neighbors\u2019 feud hasn\u2019t simmered down since he was recorded hurling homophobic and sexist slurs at the comedian in September.\n\nIn October, Mezger filed for his own restraining order against Griffin \u2014 two weeks after she filed one against him.\n\nFollowing the initial tirade, KB Homes\u2019 board threatened to fire Mezger \u201cif in the future there is any similar incident.\u201d", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/09/griffin.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/09/griffin.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/03/coel-haan-2.png?w=300&h=200&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png"], "top_img": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/09/griffin.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["December"], "canonical_link": "https://nypost.com/2017/12/18/kathy-griffins-neighbor-calls-her-stupid-b-tch-amid-legal-battle/", "title": "Kathy Griffin claims neighbor called her \u2018stupid b-tch\u2019 as legal battle escalates", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.

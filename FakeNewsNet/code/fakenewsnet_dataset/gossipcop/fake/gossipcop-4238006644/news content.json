I was like, \u2018Oh, maybe there\u2019s a kernel of truth to that.\u2019 It\u2019s been a little devastating because for us, it\u2019s like, \u2018What the heck?\u2019\u201d the then-38-year-old actress said.\n\n\u201cThis has been blindsiding to us. We have an incredible relationship. It has been weirdly stinging,\u201d she added.\n\nALLIED\n\nMidway through the promotion tour for Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard\u2019s 2017 movie Allied, Pitt\u2019s marriage to Angelina Jolie \u2014 one of the most high profile in Hollywood \u2014 abruptly came to an end.\n\nThe French actress was immediately in the firing line following Jolie\u2019s decision to file for divorce \u2014 a rumour Cotillard quickly shut down.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be my first and only reaction to the whirlwind news that broke 24 hours ago and that I was swept up into. I am not used to commenting on things like this nor taking them seriously but as this situation is spiralling and affecting people I love, I have to speak up,\u201d she began.\n\nThe actress went on to slam the rumours she was \u201cthe other woman\u201d, instead revealing she was pregnant with her and her partner\u2019s second child.\n\n\u201cFirstly, many years ago, I met the man of my life, father of our son and of the baby we are expecting. He is my love, my best friend, the only one that I need. Secondly to those who have indicated that I am devastated, I am very well thank you.\u201d\n\nCotillard has been with partner French actor and director Guillaume Canet since 2007 and he also came to her defence on Instagram, slamming the \u201cvenal stupidity\u201d of the rumours and urged people to stop \u201cconstantly coming out with s**t\u201d.\n\nAnd while these two might be completely fake, there\u2019s obviously precedent for the blaming, and here\u2019s a few reasons why fans go into a frenzy if couples break up immediately after shooting a movie.\n\nMR & MRS SMITH\n\nIf there\u2019s one movie everyone knows as the one that ended a relationship, it\u2019s Mr and Mrs Smith.\n\nBrad Pitt and Angelina Jolie\u2019s on-screen chemistry seemed a little too realistic and Jennifer Aniston\u2019s abrupt separation from Pitt the same year the movie was filmed seemed to confirm everyone\u2019s suspicions.\n\nAnnouncing their split in January 2005, the Hollywood golden couple finalised their divorce by October the same year. Three months later Jolie confirmed to PEOPLE she was pregnant with her and Pitt\u2019s first child.\n\nPitt and Jolie have both confirmed they fell in love while making the 2005 movie with Jolie telling the New York Times, \u201cnot a lot of people get to see a movie where their parents fell in love\u201d.\n\nSadly it\u2019s all over now with Jolie filing for divorce in September 2016.\n\nVANILLA SKY\n\nWhen people used to think of Hollywood golden couples, the top of the list was always Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.\n\nBut a month before filming wrapped on Cruise\u2019s 2001 film Vanilla Sky, the actor filed for divorce from his wife, not long after they\u2019d celebrated their 10 year wedding anniversary.\n\nWhile the couple\u2019s publicists eventually said the separation was mutual, blame fell on Cruise\u2019s Vanilla Sky co-star Penelope Cruz.\n\nThe pair started dating not long after Vanilla Sky hit cinemas but, after three years together their relationship ran its course and they ended things in 2004.\n\nKidman and Cruz went on to star together in the 2009 movie Nine and have been good friends ever since.\n\nPROOF OF LIFE\n\nMeg Ryan and Dennis Quaid were picture perfect for nine years \u2014 right up until the actress met Russell Crowe on the set of the 2000 movie Proof Of Life.\n\nIt was always rumoured in tabloids the couple had a brief affair during filming and Quaid and Ryan later divorced.\n\nRyan copped most of the heat for the end of their marriage. And in an interview with InStyle in 2008, the actress acknowledged the rumours and claimed her ex-husband had been unfaithful during their time together.\n\n\u201cIt was a great story,\u201d she told the publication. \u201cBut what wasn\u2019t in the story was the reality of my marriage for nine years. Dennis was not faithful to me for a very long time, and that was very painful. I found out more about that after I was divorced.\u201d\n\nTalking about Crowe, she said: \u201cI think he took a big hit. But Russell didn\u2019t break up the marriage. He was definitely there at the end, but it wasn\u2019t his fault. I was a mess. I hurt him too at the end. I couldn\u2019t be in another long relationship, it wasn\u2019t the time for that. So I got out.\u201d \u201cMy time as a scarlet woman was really interesting. As painful as it was, it was also incredible liberating. Now I was utterly free. I didn\u2019t have to care about what people thought.\u201d\n\nDREAM HOUSE\n\nRachel Weisz and Daniel Craig had been friends for years before starring in the 2011 movie Dream House but clearly acting as husband and wife on-screen led to something more.\n\nBoth stars of the movie left their respective partners almost immediately after filming ended with Craig ending his five-year engagement with producer Satsuki Mitchell and Weisz ending her nine-year relationship with director Darren Aronofsky.\n\nLess than six months of dating, Craig and Weisz married in June, 2011 \u2014 a wedding that didn\u2019t sit well with their former partners.\n\nMitchell\u2019s father Christopher spoke to the Daily Mailweeks after the wedding, claiming his daughter was \u201cabsolutely bewildered\u201d at their marriage.\n\n\u201cWe heard about it like everyone else, by reading the newspapers. She doesn\u2019t mention his name now and tells me off if I do,\u201d he told the publication.\n\nWeisz was also slated to star in Aronofsky\u2019s biopic of Jackie Kennedy not long after Dream House but she was instead dropped from the movie and replaced by Natalie Portman who went on to score an Oscar nomination for her role.\n\nAronofsky has been dating Jennifer Lawrence since September, 2016 after they met on the set of Mother!", "images":

We\u2019re good people. We\u2019re trying to do the right thing.\u201d\n\nAt stake is Beckham\u2019s post-playing future, and the dream of forming a football team in Florida \u2013 a dream first announced in 2014.\n\nAt the time, a year after the footballing star\u2019s retirement, it was greeted with jubilation. Amid a frenzy of speculation, it took less than a week for Cristiano Ronaldo to be connected to Beckham's Miami team. Multiple media sources reported that Beckham and his team had targeted the Portuguese star for a move to Miami in \"three years' time\".", "images":

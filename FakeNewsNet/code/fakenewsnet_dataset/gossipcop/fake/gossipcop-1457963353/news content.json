It\u2019s going to cost you. The Rampage star is asking for a $1 million social-media fee as part of his package for the upcoming Red Notice; that includes promoting the film on the likes of Twitter and Facebook.\u2019\n\nOTHER NEWS YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED: Man Who Stabbed Morgan Freeman\u2019s Step-Granddaughter 25 Times Convicted Of Manslaughter\n\nAccording to the report, Johnson will likely be 2018\u2019s highest paid actor due to the volume of movies he cranks out. The same Variety report also looked at his earning power, as Johnson is one of the few celebrities who has managed to cultivate an attentive following on social media, which has resulted in him having over 12 million followers on Twitter and over 100 million followers on Instagram.\n\nJohnson will be paid $22 million for his upcoming 2020 film \u201cRed Notice,\u201d with $1 million of that ensuring he will promote the film on his Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts.\n\nHis payday came just behind Daniel Craig, who is reported to receive $25 million for the latest James Bond film.\n\nAnne Hathaway is also set to take home $15 million for the 2020 film \u201cBarbie,\u201d while Jennifer Lawrence took home that same amount to play a Russian spy in \u201cRed Sparrow.\u201d",

A source close to her EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com that it\u2019s affecting her appetite.\n\nNot only is parting such sweet sorrow, it\u2019s also such stressful sorrow, too. Angelina Jolie, 42, and Brad Pitt, 53, may have caused all our hearts to break after the two broke up and filed for divorce, but the resulting anxiety over their split \u2014 and how it has reorganized their family structure \u2014 still lingers for the Malificent actress. A source EXCLUSIVELY gave us the deets on how Angelina\u2019s post-marriage life has changed her diet and health. \u201cAll of the stress really took a toll on Angelina, and her main focus now, aside from the kids, is getting her health back on track again,\u201d our source said. \u201cWhenever she\u2019s under stress, Angelina always loses her appetite, and unless she has someone by her side making sure she\u2019s eating regularly, she has a tendency to skip meals and lose weight, which really isn\u2019t good, as she\u2019s so thin anyway. Now that she\u2019s finally feeling better emotionally though, she can start concentrating on her health again.\u201d\n\nWhile there have been reports that Angelina might be planning her fourth wedding to a wealthy philanthropist, our source has set the record straight on whether or not wedding bells are in the future for Angelina. \u201cAngelina has no plan, or desire, to get married again\u2014her divorce from Brad isn\u2019t even finalized yet\u2014so God only knows where the wedding reports have come from,\u201d the source added. \u201cThe past year, following the split from Brad, has been monumentally stressful and challenging for Angelina, and she\u2019s only now getting to the point where she feels she can breathe again.\u201d\n\nWe reported earlier how there\u2019s some major tension between Brad and Angelina over how the two will divvy up time with their children over the holidays. Check out the celebrities, including Angelina, who were allegedly sexually blackmailed by Harvey Weinstein, 65.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Angelina\u2019s stress levels will finally cool down, or do you think the holiday season will only amp them up?", "images": ["https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1728231595.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/kylie-jenner-tory-lanez-megan-thee-stallion-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/angelina-jolie-skinny-pics-positve-ftr.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/angelina-jolie-skinny-pics-positve-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/fall-2020-shoe-trends.gif?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/tim_mcgovern.jpg?w=48", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1226929918c.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/solo-a-star-wars-story-screengrab.png?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/the-100-bellamy-dead.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/heather-morris-reacts-naya-rivera-death-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/naya-rivera-son-shutterstock-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/angelina-jolie-skinny-pics-positve-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tim Mcgovern", "Katherine Speller", "Maggie Griswold", "Andy Swift", "Ryan Bort", "Zack Sharf", "Weekend Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/11/13/angelina-jolie-skinny-pics-focused-on-improving-health/", "title": "Angelina Jolie Focused On Improving Health & Well-Being As Fans Worry Over \u2018Skinny\u2019 Pics", "meta_data": {"description": "According to a source, Angelina Jolie is focused on her health again after skipping meals due to stress.", "news_keywords": "Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Angelina Jolie Focused On Improving Health & Well-Being As Fans Worry Over \u2018Skinny\u2019 Pics", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/11/13/angelina-jolie-skinny-pics-focused-on-improving-health/", "description": "Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt may be officially split up, but the stress from their breakup might still be lingering.

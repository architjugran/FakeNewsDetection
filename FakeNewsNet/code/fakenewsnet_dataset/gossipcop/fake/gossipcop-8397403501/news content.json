Get EXCLUSIVE details here.\n\nWoah! Angelina Jolie, , and Sean Penn, 57, are reportedly turning to one another for many conversations and it may be leading to something other than just a friendship. \u201cAngelina has been speaking to Sean a lot recently, and he\u2019s made it clear that he would love to take her out to dinner and get to know her better, on a personal level,\u201d a source close to Angelina EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com. \u201cThey\u2019ve known each other for years, and even spent time together while Sean was filming Tree of Life with Brad [Pitt], back in 2011, but they were both involved with other people at that time, so there was no flirting and it was strictly as friends, and in a group situation.\u201d Since Sean and Brad are known to be good friends, we think this could be a tad bit awkward, especially if Angelina and Sean become a serious item in the future!\n\nThere is a possibility of a romance between the two talented stars, but they are taking things slow and no matter how long it takes, Sean is not ready to give up on the brunette beauty. \u201cSean thinks Angelina is amazing\u2014he loves her dedication to humanitarian work, and really admires how smart and deep she is, not to mention, stunningly beautiful,\u201d the source continued. \u201cAngelina really has no interest in dating right now though, she\u2019s focused on the kids and her work, and really isn\u2019t interested in getting involved with anybody. Sean\u2019s not one to give up however, once he sets his sights on something he\u2019s pretty dogged in pursuing it until he achieves his aims\u2014so, it\u2019s unlikely he\u2019s just going to fold. He\u2019s happy to bide his time, flirting and ingratiating himself with Angelina, and he\u2019s confident she\u2019ll give in to his charms eventually.\u201d Sean is definitely a charmer. After all, just think of the amazing women he\u2019s romanced in the past: Madonna, Charlize Theron, and even Jewel!\n\nAngelina seems to be enjoying the single life by focusing on her six children since her split from Brad but we can\u2019t help but wonder when she\u2019ll decide to date again. The award-winning actress has made several appearances at public award ceremonies and events in the past few months and she\u2019s looked incredible each time. Whether she\u2019s rockin\u2019 the single life or workin\u2019 it as a doting life, she sure knows how to capture attention with confidence and grace.", "images": ["https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/tory-lanez-and-megan-thee-stallion-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/melissa-gorga-bikini-real-housewives-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/rihanna-fenty-beauty.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/happy-endings-streaming.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/angelina-jolie-sean-penn-still-talk-rex-ftr.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/angelina-jolie-sean-penn-still-talk-rex-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://i0.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Walter-Mercado-Netflix-doc-2_resize.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://i2.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_editorial_10532387rz.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1218842357c.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/erin_silvia1.jpg?w=48", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/benjamin-keough-cuase-of-death-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/angelina-jolie-sean-penn-still-talk-rex-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erin Silvia", "Eugenia Richman", "Maggie Griswold", "Vlada Gelman", "Ethan Millman", "Kate Erbland", "News Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/03/04/angelina-jolie-sean-penn-flirting-romance/", "title": "Angelina Jolie & Sean Penn Talking \u2018A Lot\u2019 Claims Source \u2014 He Thinks She\u2019s \u2018Amazing & Stunningly Beautiful\u2019", "meta_data": {"description": "Angelina Jolie &amp; Sean Penn have been talking a lot: Is there a new romance on the horizon?", "news_keywords": "Angelina Jolie, Sean Penn", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Angelina Jolie & Sean Penn Talking \u2018A Lot\u2019 Claims Source \u2014 He Thinks She\u2019s \u2018Amazing & Stunningly Beautiful\u2019", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/03/04/angelina-jolie-sean-penn-flirting-romance/", "description": "Angelina Jolie and Sean Penn have reportedly been getting to know each other and may even be ready to try dating soon.

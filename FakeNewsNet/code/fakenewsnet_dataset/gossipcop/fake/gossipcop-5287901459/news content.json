And based on one photo shoot, we'd say Tarek is in pretty good shape. Back in March of 2017, Tarek was photographed by California-based Lin and Jirsa Wedding Photography Team. \"This is after battling 2 cancers and a debilitating back injury. My doctor said 'You would probably never be able to lift weights again'... that motivated me to prove him wrong and get into the best shape of my life!!!\" he shared on Instagram. \"Thank you to my trainer @quintin_tucker for all the hard work and motivation and @pyejirsa for the amazing photos. Remember....it's not the size of the dog in the fight, it's the size of the fight in the dog...\"\n\nHe Trusts in the Experts: After Tarek participated in a photo shoot , E! News talked to his trainer Quintin Tucker who had plenty of praise for his client. \"I have seen Tarek transform from a very sad and weathered version of himself to the strongest and happiest version of himself I have seen to date,\" Quintin previously shared with us. \"The amount of motivation and fight Tarek had in the beginning is unmatched by any other client I have yet had and was paramount to his recovery. Session after session he would always say, 'I'm going to be your biggest transformation, I'm going to get back into the best shape of my life,' and he did.\"", "images": ["https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/201844/rs_600x600-180504132554-600-tarek-el-moussa-mv-5418.jpg?fit=around|1080:1080&output-quality=90&crop=1080:1080;center,top"], "top_img": "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/201844/rs_600x600-180504132554-600-tarek-el-moussa-mv-5418.jpg?fit=around|1080:1080&output-quality=90&crop=1080:1080;center,top", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.eonline.com/news/932478/5-reasons-why-tarek-el-moussa-will-overcome-his-latest-back-injury", "title": "5 Reasons Why Tarek El Moussa Will Overcome His Latest Back Injury", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "google-site-verification": "jOadQCDbZTkKw5sn27yXszjIb9c3PdMPHENN92uPWy8", "msvalidate.01": "564B986CE3CECCAE84779191BEC6B755", "fb": {"admins": 10101649, "pages": 1387539234854280, "app_id": 195662528604}, "og": {"title": "5 Reasons Why Tarek El Moussa Will Overcome His Latest Back Injury - E!

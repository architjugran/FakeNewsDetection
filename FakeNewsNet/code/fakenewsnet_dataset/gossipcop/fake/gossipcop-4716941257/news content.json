Our insider has the EXCLUSIVE details! Read on!\n\nNothing tests a marriage like infidelity. And all that heartbreak is presumably dialed up to 11 when it\u2019s a highly publicized ordeal like Kevin Hart\u2018s, 38, current cheating scandal. All this has fans wondering if and when his pregnant wife Eniko Parrish, 33, is going to call it quits! Well, according to our insider, the stunning mama-to-be has no intention of ending their marriage! Need more pics of Kevin and Eniko? Head right here!\n\n\u201cEniko is hurt and angry but she\u2019s nowhere near ready to walk away,\u201d a source close to Eniko shares with HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cShe simply can\u2018t imagine her life without Kevin. He\u2019s her world and it\u2019s been that way since she was 23 years old. Throwing it all away over one mistake is just not something she can do right now.\u201d Wow! She sounds ready for the long haul! Maybe Kevin\u2019s push present helped as well!?\n\nOur insider went on to add that staying is more about her baby\u2019s future than her own. It\u2019s also a way to maintain some stability as they ride out this painful controversy. \u201cLeaving him is not even a question, she\u2019s in her third trimester and already thinking like a mamma bear. Her child\u2019s needs come first. And right now Eniko knows she needs to stay as calm and centered as possible. Breaking up with Kevin right now is only going to put more stress on her.\u201d Here\u2019s hoping things improve before their baby arrives.\n\nHollywoodLifers, what do YOU think? Should Eniko leave her world-famous hubby and start over? Or should she stay in the marriage and work to get past this bump in the road?

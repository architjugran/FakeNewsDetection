George wants to make sure the twins enter the world in the most royal manner possible.\n\nAccording to entertainment portal Aceshowbiz.com, the Hollywood star has rented out the entire Kensington Wing at London's Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, which essentially comes down to $580,000 for a week's stay. Amal is also apparently flying in two 'birth companions' from Los Angeles for around $30,000. George also wants Amal to be completely relaxed during the birth, which is why he hired an Italian masseuse for the hotshot lawyer for $5,000.\n\nThe couple is already known to be pretty generous with their money. Amidst reports that they might spend a million dollars on their nursery, George and Amal reportedly gave their neighbours a \u00a345,000 compensation package for the noise caused by the renovations to their estate recently. The package was said to include a holiday to Corfu, a six-week stay in a luxury hotel and a \u00a330,000 lump sum. In addition, the Clooneys paid for their neighbours to rent a \u00a3780,000 cottage.\n\nRecently, George was advised on raising twins by Prince Albert of Monaco, who has twins himself. He said \"George should pour himself a good cup of coffee each morning.\" He also added that he'd better get \"some sleep stored away before the babies are born\".", "images":

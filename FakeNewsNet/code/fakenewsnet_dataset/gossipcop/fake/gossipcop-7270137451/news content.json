Fortunately, a 7 hour wait for the next flight to Houston won\u2019t affect me that much, but my heart sank for the elderly and parents with small children who did their best to walk all that way but had no chance of making their flights. I love witnessing people exercise their right to protest! But it saddened me to see the joy on their faces knowing that they were successful in disrupting so many people\u2019s travel plans. Yes, immigrants were affected by this as well. Brilliant. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\n\nOn Instagram, in an effort to stand up for the immigrants and refugees affected by the ban, many commentors criticized her for what they believed wasn\u2019t seeing the bigger picture. Many also resorted to using slurs to describe the ESPN personality, which is really just a reminder that social media can be terrible all around.\n\nSteele defended herself \u2014 and her post \u2014 on Twitter:\n\n@MikeSilver better, more effective ways to do it, Silver! Re-read my post. Don't worry \u2014 we can arm wrestle over it this week in Houston \u2014 Sage Steele (@sagesteele) January 30, 2017\n\n@MikeSilver all good\u2026not the first time we disagree! :) but the crazy thing is, we can talk about it like adults & agree to disagree! \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \u2014 Sage Steele (@sagesteele) January 30, 2017", "images": ["https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/ap-chiefs-jones-football-e1594752007356.jpg?w=34&h=20&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/writer.jpg?w=48&h=48&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/logo-usat-bar.png", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/gty_482109162.jpg?w=1000&h=600&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/usp-mlb_-new-york-yankees-workouts.jpg?w=34&h=20&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/gty-1184740879-e1577666633986.jpg?w=34&h=20&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/usp-nfl_-pro-football-hall-of-fame-enshrinement-e1594748049135.jpg?w=34&h=20&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/xxx_espn_radio_-_mike_and_mike_-_inaugural_show_go_27250059-e1513082450868.jpg?w=100&h=60&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/c03_vert_28_90610436-e1499262956884.jpg?w=100&h=60&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/ap-hornets-mavericks-basketball-e1578404923876.jpg?w=24&h=24&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/ftw-icon-section-head.png", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/gty_482109162.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/gettyimages-1198848412.jpg?w=34&h=20&crop=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/usp-nba_-los-angeles-lakers-at-los-angeles-clipper-1.jpg?w=24&h=24&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/gty-1208740503-1.jpg?w=24&h=24&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/logo-ftw.png", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/c03_vert_28_90610436-e1522864559458.jpg?w=100&h=60&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/gty_482109162.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nina Mandell", "Charles Curtis", "Nate Scott", "January"], "canonical_link": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/01/sage-steele-instagram-airport-espn", "title": "Sage Steele slammed for Instagram post about protests at airport", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BP4TLbAFYiG/ Sage Steele, like many sports figures, found herself in the middle of the\u00a0debate over Donald Trump's new immigration policy over the weekend -- and received a lot of backlash for her comments about the protests at airports.", "keywords": "media, espn, media, sage steele", "fb": {"app_id": 451360081611296, "admins": 1651440013}, "google-site-verification": "no3A69hVM5ut63_reMWqC5VegUmDtCMsgeO4Wh_iBY8", "msvalidate.01": "6C7AFE373C691E833D6444FFA7F6E8A2", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Sage Steele slammed for Instagram post about protests at airport", "url": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/01/sage-steele-instagram-airport-espn", "description": "Sage Steele, like many sports figures, found herself in the middle of the\u00a0debate over Donald Trump\u2019s new immigration policy over the weekend \u2014 and received a lot of backlash for her com\u2026", "site_name": "For The Win", "image": {"identifier": "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/gty_482109162.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 576}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-01-30T16:48:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-01-30T18:41:24+00:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usatodayftw", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ninamandell1"}, "twitter": {"creator": "@ForTheWin", "site": "@forthewin", "text": {"title": "Sage Steele slammed for Instagram post about protests at airport"}, "image": "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/gty_482109162.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "gdpr": "false", "sop-property": "581b62d42a2cc300124a6a6e", "application-name": "For The Win", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-tooltip": "What fans are talking about.", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=https://ftw.usatoday.com/feed;icon-uri=https://secure.gravatar.com/blavatar/2ef498b87825ac1e90fb08b478c63932?s=16", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1485794900.0, "source": "http://ftw.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}

The Toronto rapper\u2019s first sneaker collaboration will launch early in 2021. This is not the first collaboration between Drake and Nike. Nike borrowed Drake\u2019s owl logo for a limited edition release of Air Jordan products including sweats and shoes. Red and purple editions of Air Jordan 4s, that were released to celebrate the championship of the Raptors also used Drake\u2019s owl logo. Instagram page @zsneakerheadz was the first to report about the Drake Nike collaboration providing a mockup and even implying that Nike might release Air Force 1 and Drake\u2019s OVO together in 2021. Besides the above-mentioned Air Jordan series, Drake has also worked with Nike on a golden pair of Jordan 3, that the fans saw him wearing in 2014 OVO Fest and another pair of Jordan 3 that he has on Nicki Minaj\u2019s music video for Anaconda. Nike is not the only brand Drake works with regularly. He has collaborations with Roots, Dsquared2, Takashi Murakami, and others. Footwear brands that he joins forces with include Clarks and Timberland.\n\nFans are waiting for private shows\n\nWill Drake be coming back to do the live shows in 2020 or 2021? This is the question that the fans want to know the answer to. The music industry, like so many other industries, was drastically changed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The concerts were canceled around the globe in all kinds of venues. While some stars, including Michael Buble, have already announced the dates for their concerts in 2021, there is still no word from Drake on the subject. All his performances for 2020 were canceled. He released \u201cDarke Lane Demo Tapes\u201d that made it to the top of the charts in Canada and the United States and now he is reportedly working on a new album. Rumor has it that the star performers such as Drake might be giving private performances in smaller venues before the world is back to normal and big concert halls are open again. Canadian casinos might be the first to host the performances for a VIP audience. Drake has already done the same thing for his country\u2019s VIP residents. During the VIP night, casino venues offer Drake\u2019s performance along with Canadian real money casino games. The guests would be able to enjoy casino games such as poker tables, roulette, slot and other gaming machines while enjoying the live performances of their favorite stars. The fans would love to listen to Drake perform the songs from \u201cDark Lane Demo Tapes\u201d and the rumored new album. With so many new songs Drake would have a big return to the stage. As most of the countries entered stage one of the reopening after the pandemic, bars, restaurants, and casinos are allowed to reopen with limited capacity.\n\nDrake New Album Rumors: DJ Akademiks Shares Major Hints\n\nThe pandemic did not stop Drake from working. Reportedly, he is releasing his sixth studio album this summer. The word has been going around for months now and at this point, the fans just want to hear an official announcement about it. According to DJ Akademiks\u2019 source YouTube\u2019s divisions, Pandora and SiriusXM are working on the final details of the contract with Drake for his sixth studio album. Drake might make a video where he will perform his songs from his previous albums for thirty minutes and in an additional fifteen minutes address his fans and share the information about the new album. Neither Drake nor anybody on his team has confirmed the information yet, but the fans are still excited. His sixth album would be a big deal. This could happen anytime from July 2nd to August. With all the concerts and events canceled Drake might actually have time to work on the sixth album.\n\nLoading...\n\n(Visited 1 time, 1 visit today)\n\nShare\n\nWhatsApp\n\nTweet\n\n", "images": ["https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/P36GIF320x320px.gif", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7259ab27-831c-44bb-9779-6737779e7585-80x80.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/86724603-3e3c-4ceb-a5e5-d33cb195c78f-400x240.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/APass-X-Bryan-400x240.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Untitled-design-21-400x240.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/6a150417-e3da-4e82-8193-1dffeb24a32a-80x80.jpg", "http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/924fa8b400fc490d23f1664722536ad3?s=46&d=mm&r=g", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/output_m2333G.gif", "http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a03fc71537ab727188b33520e8d8d6d5?s=46&d=mm&r=g", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ICB_WEB-BANNERS_CONTRACTOR_300x250px.gif", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Danra.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/86724603-3e3c-4ceb-a5e5-d33cb195c78f-80x80.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/img_9993-1-400x240.jpg", "http://bigeye.ug/wp-content/plugins/page-views-count/ajax-loader.gif", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/spl383107_002.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1bb38a4c-7d7c-48e6-bea6-cff20d183ec8.jpg", "http://i0.wp.com/bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/KBM-.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Douglas-Smith-400x240.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Douglas-Smith-80x80.jpg", "http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b9e9eb56d37576a3f8637a5d18b3a607?s=46&d=mm&r=g", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/APass-X-Bryan-80x80.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/P36GIF720x90px.gif", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/21533890-96c5-451f-b0c1-ea958b67e7bb.jpg", "http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f18b50e32044e81ec5d02c9969234901?s=46&d=mm&r=g", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/300X250-4.gif", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Carole-Sekimpi-400x240.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=2126143654382858&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/img_9993-1-80x80.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Carole-Sekimpi-80x80.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7259ab27-831c-44bb-9779-6737779e7585-400x240.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Bigeye-Logo-min.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ICB_WEB-BANNERS_CONTRACTOR_728x90px.gif", "http://i0.wp.com/bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Statement-NBS-TV.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Untitled-design-21-80x80.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/6a150417-e3da-4e82-8193-1dffeb24a32a-400x240.jpg"], "top_img": "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/spl383107_002.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://bigeye.ug/justin-bieber-selena-gomezs-rekindled-romance-ended-when-he-couldnt-promise-her-marriage/", "title": "Justin Bieber & Selena Gomez\u2019s Rekindled Romance Ended When \u2018He Couldn\u2019t Promise\u2019 Her Marriage", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "google-site-verification": "lJDxciuEsdLMBCmQ3AkfM85a-oAOcQSaGiMrCBH5zXU", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Justin Bieber & Selena Gomez\u2019s Rekindled Romance Ended When \u2018He Couldn\u2019t Promise\u2019 Her Marriage - BigEye.UG", "description": "Itel has new affordable phones to take you a step faster.More here.Selena Gomez had to walk away from Justin Bieber when he couldn\u2019t promise her a serious future that included marriage.

Many expected for the split rumors to surface online soon after.\n\nInstead, Rihanna reassured her fans by telling them that she is a lioness and her man is the king of the jungle, and they sometimes roar at each other \u2014 especially over the FIFA World Cup.\n\nA source close to the actress said do not fear for her couple because they are at each other\u2019s throats, they break up and get right back together in bed.\n\nThe insider shared: \u201cRihanna and Hassan have an extremely passionate and intense relationship, with a tendency to break-up and make-up fairly frequently. They have a powerful physical connection, and when they fight it can get pretty heated, but then they have crazy good make-up sex, and everything is great between them until they fight again.\u201d\n\nThe family friend continued by explaining: \u201cBoth Rihanna and Hassan suffer from a jealous streak, and as they lead very independent lives, it can cause problems between them a lot.\u201d\n\nThe same insider went on to share that the pair\u2019s complicated schedules contribute to the many fights and breakups.\n\nThe pal confessed: \u201cRihanna really is crazy about Hassan, but it\u2019s hard to see how they can make their relationship work long term unless she is willing to scale back on her career, which isn\u2019t likely to happen. Conversely, Hassan isn\u2019t about to cut back on his work commitments so he can fit in with Rihanna\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nOne fan reacted to the news by saying: \u201cRihanna is the only female goals I need in my life\u2026 cussing out a billionaire while smoking a blunt\u2026I adore you.\u201d\n\nAnother commenter explained: \u201cWhen you know you messed up, so you have to make a joke. She is so immature, Hassan is the opposite.\u201d\n\nThis third supporter stated: \u201cWhats really sad about this picture? Those lions are obviously captive. They\u2019ve been socialized in grotesquely strange circumstances. For there entire lives. And yes it is an example of male-female relations in the African American community. Sorry I know its a light fun picture but I wish my brothers and sisters could get along and stay married for many years like we used to.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne thing is for sure, Rihanna has moved on from Chris Brown.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Rihanna-New-Savage-x-Fenty-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/demi-lovato-reminisces-about-playing-naya-riveras-girlfriend-on-glee-calls-the-late-actress-an-inspiring-latina-300x210.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Hassan-Jameel-Rihanna.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jimmy-fallon-returns-to-the-studio-for-the-tonight-show-but-with-major-changes-300x210.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/maxresdefault-1-3-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/kandi-burruss-husband-todd-tucker-300x274.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/drake-rihanna-700x466.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2060%2060%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2042%2042%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Rihanna-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201800%201488%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%2035%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Amal-Clooney-George-Motorbike-Tom-Cruise-Scooter-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/DylanFisher-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/moore-brooklyn-300x158.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/courtney-stodden-has-no-time-for-f-boys-300x220.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dancing-with-the-stars-is-making-some-major-changes-for-season-29-300x210.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%2027%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/kandi-burruss8217-new-8216speak-on-it8217-episode-is-out-and-addresses-another-issue-involving-todd-tucker8217s-daughter-kaela-82-300x216.jpg"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Hassan-Jameel-Rihanna.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dylan Fisher", "Angie Williamson", "Angela Williamson"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/rihanna-has-been-on-and-off-with-hassan-jameel-for-two-years-surprising-revelations-mean-it-is-over-for-chris-brown-168831/", "title": "Rihanna Has Been On And Off With Hassan Jameel For Two Years \u2014 Surprising Revelations Mean It Is Over For Chris Brown", "meta_data": {"author": "Dylan Fisher", "news_keywords": "Hassan Jameel, rihanna", "keywords": "celebrity news, Hassan Jameel, rihanna", "p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "theme-color": "#dedede", "description": "Blame it on passion and wild desire -- Rihanna and her Saudi lover, Hassan Jameel, have been together for about two years now and have been able to", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Rihanna Has Been On And Off With Hassan Jameel For Two Years \u2014 Surprising Revelations Mean It Is Over For Chris Brown", "description": "Blame it on passion and wild desire -- Rihanna and her Saudi lover, Hassan Jameel, have been together for about two years now and have been able to", "url": "https://celebrityinsider.org/rihanna-has-been-on-and-off-with-hassan-jameel-for-two-years-surprising-revelations-mean-it-is-over-for-chris-brown-168831/", "image": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Hassan-Jameel-Rihanna.jpg", "site_name": "Breaking Celebrity News, Entertainment News, and Celebrity Gossip -

Now, you might think this sounds like a decent idea \u2015 if you ignore the couple\u2019s very public breakup and subsequent divorce in 2005 that culminated with Pitt\u2019s marriage to Angelina Jolie, which produced seemingly dozens of children. You\u2019d also have to ignore Aniston\u2019s highly paparazzi-ed dating life that took her to a marriage with Justin Theroux \u2015 and a split that she announced on Thursday.\n\nReuters Photographer / Reuters Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston, in this September 19, 2004 file photo. Aniston filed for divorce on March 25, 2005. And now, after her split from Justin Theroux, people are cheering for an Anniston-Pitt reunion.\n\nIgnoring all of that, then sure. A Jen and Brad reunion, 13 years, many children and much heartbreak later, would be fan-freakin\u2019-tastic. But we do not live in that fantasy world. This is the real world, where our actual president was known as a reality TV star and real estate mogul a mere three years ago. Yet, as soon as the news broke of Aniston being single, the tweets started flying and hopes for a reunion with Pitt began growing:\n\nSomewhere, Jennifer Aniston is crafting her \"Hey, let's grab coffee and catch up\" text to Brad Pitt. https://t.co/pXLGo7O4Mp \u2014 Madeline Hill (@mad_hill) February 15, 2018\n\nALL I'M SAYING is that jennifer aniston and brad pitt are now both single at the same time \u2014 Alex Bruce-Smith (@alexbrucesmith) February 15, 2018\n\nI can't even decide if I want Brad sending Jen a \"u up?\" text \u2014 Michelle Markowitz (@michmarkowitz) February 16, 2018\n\nJennifer Aniston: single \u2714\ufe0f\n\nBrad Pitt: single \u2714\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/glMAiNSQXz \u2014 Mrs. Robot (@soyluluuu) February 16, 2018\n\nBrad Pitt and Angelina Jolie split.

And the timing could not be better \u2014 as Blake is going through his own breakup from his now-ex, Gwen Stefani.\n\n\u201cMiranda reached out to Blake via text,\u201d a source close to the former spouses tells In Touch exclusively. \u201cUltimately, they buried the hatchet and have been supporting each other through their latest troubled relationships. They\u2019ve become close friends and allies over the past month or so.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a future that no one could\u2019ve imagined for the exes, who were married for five years before calling it quits in 2015. At that time, it seemed unlikely that the two would ever reconcile, but now that the time has been able to pass, the two have become each other\u2019s closest allies \u2014 and those closest to them say even a romantic reunion isn\u2019t totally out of the question. \u201cThey have developed into close confidantes and are sharing intimate details of their lives,\u201d the source adds exclusively.\n\nIt turns out the timing for their reunion could not have been more perfect. Anderson decided to call it quits with Miranda after spending nearly three years together. Elsewhere in Hollywood, Blake decided to cool things off with Gwen after growing more and more tired of her constant \u201cdrama\u201d and their disagreements when it came to starting a family together.\n\nAnd despite both women having the plug pulled on their relationships, they couldn\u2019t be handling it more differently. While Miranda is left qusetioning what the future of her love life will look like, she refuses to dwell on the past. \u201cHer allegiance is to her songs, the road, and her fans right now,\u201d another insider says of Miranda. Gwen is taking the news as well as Miranda. \u201cShe continues to send [Blake] loving social media support from LA while he\u2019s been out on the road,\u201d another insider says of the mother-of-three. \u201cBut Blake has drastically slowed regular communication with her.\u201d\n\nFollowing his increased frustrations with Gwen, a source close to Blake says \u201che\u2019s \u201cjust a simple, country guy who wants his family and his woman by his side. And that woman isn\u2019t Gwen.\u201d In the meantime, we\u2019ll all remain hopeful that the woman can be Miranda \u2014 again!", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/blake-shelton-miranda-lambert.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Jamie-and-Doug-Season-1-MAFS.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C750px%2C750px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Farrah-Abraham-Says-Her-Upcoming-Shows-Will-Be-Culturally-Diverse.jpg?crop=47px%2C0px%2C1835px%2C1040px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/miranda-lambert-anderson-east-7.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Aaron-Hernandez-Jailhouse-Lover-Claims-He-Was-Guilty-of-Double-Murder.jpg?crop=66px%2C0px%2C1534px%2C869px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Duggar-Girls-Wearing-Pants-and-Jeans.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/When-Does-Ridiculousness-Come-Back-Chanel-West-Coast-Reveals.jpg?crop=0px%2C44px%2C2151px%2C1219px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Meghan-Markle-Hated-Royal-Dress-Code-Shes-Much-More-Comfortable-Wearing-Casual-Clothes.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/naya-rivera-denim-outfit.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3271px%2C1852px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Farrah-Abraham-Says-Sophia-Craves-Getting-Know-Her-Dad-Family.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IT2319_cover_cn3_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Farrah-Abraham-Would-Be-Open-to-Reuniting-With-Her-Fellow-Teen-Mom-Stars.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/miranda-lambert.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Who-Are-Kobe-Bryants-Wife-and-Kids.jpg?crop=0px%2C69px%2C3150px%2C3150px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/blake-shelton-miranda-lambert.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chanel-West-Coasts-Calls-Costars-Rob-Dyrdek-and-Sterling-Steelo-Brim-Family.jpg?crop=0px%2C8px%2C1976px%2C1119px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/blake-shelton-miranda-lambert.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/REELZ-Profiles-Olivia-Newton-John-Health-Crisis-in-Tell-All-Special-01.jpg?crop=246px%2C0px%2C1522px%2C861px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-27-at-4.09.35-PM.png?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Lost-Resort-cast-2.jpg?resize=120%2C68"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/blake-shelton-miranda-lambert.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Carly Sitzer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/blake-shelton-miranda-lambert-support-156251/", "title": "Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert Are Supporting Each Other Through Their Breakups", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Following news that Miranda Lambert ended things with her beau Anderson East, the country music cutie found an unlikely source of support \u2014 her ex-husband, Blake Shelton.

Lisa Kudrow as Phoebe Buffay during the filming of the \u201cFriends\u201d episode \u201cThe One with Ross's Wedding: Part 1\u201d in 1998.\n\nLisa Kudrow has offered up even more proof that the cast of \u201cFriends\u201d took the name of the beloved sitcom to heart.\n\nOn Monday, the actress told People that her co-stars altered a pre-show ritual when she was pregnant during Seasons 4 and 5 to include her unborn child \u2014 her now 20-year-old son, Julian Murray Stern.\n\n\u201cThe six of us would do a huddle backstage and just say, \u2018All right, have a good show, love you love you love you love you,\u2019\u201d Kudrow, 55, told the outlet. \u201cAnd when I was pregnant, then they would say, \u2018Have a great show, love you love you \u2014 love you, little Julian!\u2019 \u2019Cause we knew it was a boy and that was his name.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cSo sweet, they included my little fetus in the huddle.\u201d", "images":

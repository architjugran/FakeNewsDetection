This is the strange and also the incredibly absurd claim that popped up in one of this week\u2019s new tabloids.\n\nGossip Cop was the one that looked into this situation and let everyone know what they have exclusively found out.\n\nVenice ? A post shared by Amal Clooney (@amalclooney) on Sep 3, 2017 at 8:52am PDT\n\nThe latest issue of Star magazine includes an article which says that the actor has been doting on his wife and twins since their birth. The twins are Alexander and Ella, and they were born back in June.\n\nAccording to Star\u2019s questionable report, the human rights attorney has been somehow put off by her husband\u2019s devotion to their family.\n\nA so-called insider told the same magazine that Amal secretly hopes that the actor will go back to work as soon as possible.\n\nThe same source added that \u2018George thinks he\u2019s helping but he\u2019s really just making more work for Amal. Sometimes she jokes it\u2019s like having three kids!\u2019\n\nStar\u2019s dubious insider continues, \u2018George isn\u2019t coping well with the lack of sleep. So Amal has kindly suggested that he sleep in the guest room so she can get some rest.\u2019\n\nThe magazine\u2019s assertion that Amal would be irritated with George being a caring father and husband is, of course, completely bogus and absurd as well.\n\nGossip Cop even checked with a reliable source, and the magazine\u2019s reports turned out to be ridiculous as they don\u2019t even make sense at all.\n\nGeorge recently said that parenting is not an easy thing to do, and he discussed splitting the job with his wife. Recently, he even took a break from parenting and went to have a bit of fun with a friend.\n\n#Repost @stylevoguette (@get_repost) \u30fb\u30fb\u30fb GORGEOUS @amalclooney today in Venice ?? makeup by #CharlotteTilbury ?\u2728? #stylevoguettevid A post shared by Amal Clooney (@amalclooney) on Sep 3, 2017 at 8:19am PDT\n\nStar magazine has a habit of publishing false stories about the Clooneys, so this latest fabrication isn\u2019t too surprising, at least not for us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust a little while before the birth of their twins, Gossip Cop debunked another one of the magazine\u2019s false claims: the rumor that George and Amal were spending $1 million on the delivery.

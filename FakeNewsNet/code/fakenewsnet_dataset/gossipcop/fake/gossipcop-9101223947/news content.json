The article, titled \u201cLife After Heartbreak,\u201d seemingly presents itself as an interview with Garner, but instead references insiders and sources who claim her split with Ben Affleck has \u201cbeen the most difficult decision for her.\u201d\n\nAnother insists Garner will \u201ceventually\u201d start dating again. \u201cShe\u2019s certainly not jumping up and down and screaming, \u2018I\u2019m single!\u2019 and planning dates,\u201d the source says. \u201cShe still says Ben was the love of her life.\u201d\n\nGarner was quick to respond to the story, writing in a statement, \u201cI did not pose for this cover. I did not participate in or authorize this article.\u201d", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593009d62100002b006fed11.jpeg?cache=5WwHBXwb1w&ops=1200_630", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1887969784608635&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://amp.assets.huffpost.com/assets-1123f83be23039b1d729cd5de964f5e0/images/snapchat/huffpost-in.png", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f0d7c60220000dc09386f1e.jpeg?ops=150_150", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f0d764a250000cb09c29b09.png?cache=GsNto4BNEK&ops=150_150", "https://amp.assets.huffpost.com/assets-1123f83be23039b1d729cd5de964f5e0/images/logos/HuffPost-left.svg", "https://amp.assets.huffpost.com/assets-1123f83be23039b1d729cd5de964f5e0/images/logos/HuffPost.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f0c38912700002b09e66a9f.jpeg?ops=150_150", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59300fa9140000200048032a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_630_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f0773a22500005707c297ef.jpeg?cache=q8DwHwooBn&ops=150_150", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f0d58d2250000e909c29aee.jpeg?cache=3kpFcMBA6k&ops=150_150", "https://amp.assets.huffpost.com/assets-1123f83be23039b1d729cd5de964f5e0/images/icons/newsletter-toaster.png", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f0861ae2200002a07386c46.jpeg?ops=150_150", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=india&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f0c78fb1f00005909337f58.jpeg?ops=150_150", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f0d6c00220000dc09386f10.jpeg?ops=150_150", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f0d53421f00007f0a337fdc.jpeg?cache=fN8pCXnYiX&ops=150_150", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f0c97402500009b09c29a8a.jpeg?cache=sdgnLfFW78&ops=150_150"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/593009d62100002b006fed11.jpeg?cache=5WwHBXwb1w&ops=1200_630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Leigh Blickley", "Huffpost Us", "Senior Entertainment Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jennifer-garner-denounces-people-magazine-cover-story-about-divorce_n_593007c1e4b09ec37c3203e3", "title": "Jennifer Garner Denounces People Magazine Cover Story About Divorce", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=1000", "description": "\"I did not pose for this cover.

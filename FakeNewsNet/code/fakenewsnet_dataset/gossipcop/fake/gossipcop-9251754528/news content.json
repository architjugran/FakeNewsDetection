According to the publication, the two Hollywood stars had a number of secret meet-ups at the bungalows at the Hotel Bel-Air.\n\nThe supposed incognito source of the publication also claimed that Pitt and Berry are jumping at the opportunity of getting to know each other now that they are both single. Allegedly, although the two had crossed paths before, their respective past relationships prevented them from dating despite being attracted towards one another already.\n\nApart from claiming that Pitt and Berry were dating, the publication also said that Pitt's estranged wife, Angelina Jolie, was not happy upon learning that her would-be ex-husband was seeing Berry as, supposedly, the \"Maleficent\" actress never liked the \"Catwoman\" actress because she had always suspected that the latter had an affair with her first ex-husband, Billy Bob Thornton, whom Berry worked with in the movie \"Monster Ball.\"\n\n\"It drives her nuts that Brad's with Halle now,\" the supposed source of the Australian publication said.\n\nIt was reported last month that Pitt is, indeed, casually dating again, but sources claim that he had never gone out with Berry. Furthermore, a source of E!News has said that the actor is in no hurry to find a new love.\n\n\"He has been on a few dates but nothing serious. It's complicated for him to date and not a huge priority in his life. He can be flirty by nature though. He will always hold the door and suggests that people go ahead of him in line. He's just that kind of person. He's the nicest guy in the world,\" the incognito source of E!News revealed.", "images": ["https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/78/237857_a_963_642_7_7.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/78/237892_a_66_66.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/image/12/62/126221_w_760_509.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/78/237887_a_66_66.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/78/237868_a_130_72_7_7.png", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/78/237879_a_66_66.jpg", "https://offercdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/0/02/294_a_120_80.jpg?0950220001594732095", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/78/237869_a_130_72.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/78/237883_a_66_66.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/78/237855_a_130_72.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/78/237875_a_130_72.jpg", "http://www.christianpost.com/assets/img/arrow-stroke.svg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/78/237873_a_130_72_7_7.jpg", "https://offercdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/0/02/299_a_120_80.jpg?0948846001594732095", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/78/237889_a_66_66.jpg", "http://www.christianpost.com/assets/img/cp.svg", "https://offercdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/0/02/293_a_120_80.jpg?0950753001594732095", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/original/thumbnail/21/58/215895.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/78/237876_a_130_72_7_7.png", "http://www.christianpost.com/assets/img/logo.svg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/78/237847_a_130_72.jpg", "https://offercdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/0/02/296_a_120_80.jpg?0949655001594732095", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/78/237877_a_66_66.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/78/237866_a_130_72_7_7.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/78/237826_a_130_72.png", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/78/237872_a_66_66.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/original/thumbnail/21/58/215895.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.christianpost.com/trends/brad-pitt-halle-berry-dating-rumors-not-true-says-rep-of-world-war-z-actor.html", "title": "Brad Pitt Dating Rumors: Actor's Rep Denies Rumors of Romance With Halle Berry", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "2770D3F1DEB25A5BF965224150B525F4", "google-site-verification": "jUJZk866mtO5Gxkt7Qz98Q6XIzxevyn3ngdiSJLpP34", "keywords": "brad pitt,halle berry,brad pitt-halle berry relationship,angelina jolie", "description": "A representative of Brad Pitt has denied that he is dating Halle Berry.", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "fb": {"pages": 41093998634, "app_id": 1879686555693183}, "vf": {"uuid": "00000000-0000-4000-8000-af6d2fec0938", "topic": "reporter-vincent-alocada"}, "msapplication-config": "/assets/img/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"url": "https://www.christianpost.com/trends/brad-pitt-halle-berry-dating-rumors-not-true-says-rep-of-world-war-z-actor.html", "type": "website", "title": "Brad Pitt Dating Rumors: Actor's Rep Denies Rumors of Romance With Halle Berry", "description": "A representative of Brad Pitt has denied that he is dating Halle Berry.", "image": "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/original/thumbnail/21/58/215895.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ChristianPost", "creator": "@ChristianPost", "title": "Brad Pitt Dating Rumors: Actor's Rep Denies Rumors of Romance With Halle Berry", "description": "A representative of Brad Pitt has denied that he is dating Halle Berry.", "image": "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/original/thumbnail/21/58/215895.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517423400.0, "source": "http://www.christianpost.com", "summary": ""}

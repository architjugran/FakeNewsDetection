Katy Perry and Robert Pattinson were reportedly spotted making out at a restaurant in Los Angeles! Are they a couple?! Get the deets!\n\nAre Katy Perry, 33, and Robert Pattinson, 31, dating? They were reportedly spotted kissing during a group dinner on Jan. 26 at Taix French Restaurant in Los Angeles, a witness told Wonderwall.com. \u201cThey were making out,\u201d an onlooker told the website. The witness also added that their behavior made it seem like they were \u201ctotally a couple.\u201d Eek! See pictures of Katy and Rob together here.\n\nThe Twilight actor ended his engagement to FKA Twigs, 30, in Oct. 2017, and, as we\u2019ve previously reported, he started getting close with the \u201cSwish Swish\u201d singer in the aftermath of the split. \u201cRob\u2019s been talking and texting with Katy, and they\u2019ve become super super close,\u201d a source close to Rob previously told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cThere\u2019s always been a really strong chemistry between them, and a definite attraction, but they\u2019ve never acted on it, because all the time they\u2019ve known each other one or other of them has been involved with someone else.\u201d\n\nThe pair have both been single since his breakup with his former fianc\u00e9e, but Rob didn\u2019t immediately try to start a new relationship last fall out of respect. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that he\u2019s really into Katy, and that he fancies her like crazy, but, he\u2019s determined to not get in to some kind of rebound romance \u2014 he respects and cares about Katy way too much to risk blowing the friendship they currently have,\u201d our insider added. The American Idol judge was last romantically involved with Orlando Bloom, 41, but they ended their relationship in Feb. 2017. While nothing is confirmed yet on whether or not Rob and Katy are ~official~ we\u2019ll be holding our breath until we find out more about this blossoming romance!\n\nHollywoodLifers, are you excited about Katy and Rob possibly being a couple?", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/kidding-jim-carrey.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/courteneylarocca2.jpg?w=48", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/kylie-jenner-tory-lanez-megan-thee-stallion-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/fall-2020-shoe-trends.gif?resize=230%2C135", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/katy-perry-rob-pattinson-seen-making-out-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/quarantine-makes-me-realize-just-how-important-my-mom-friends-are.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1226929918c.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/solo-a-star-wars-story-screengrab.png?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/katy-perry-rob-pattinson-seen-making-out-ftr.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/heather-morris-reacts-naya-rivera-death-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/naya-rivera-son-shutterstock-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/katy-perry-rob-pattinson-seen-making-out-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Courteney Larocca", "Sabrina Rojas Weiss", "Maggie Griswold", "Dave Nemetz", "Ryan Bort", "Zack Sharf", "Weekend Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/01/27/robert-pattinson-katy-perry-make-out-couple-kissing/", "title": "Robert Pattinson & Katy Perry Caught Making Out At LA Cafe: They\u2019re \u2018Totally A Couple\u2019 \u2014 Report", "meta_data": {"description": "Are Katy Perry and Robert Pattinson dating?

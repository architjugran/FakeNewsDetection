Scott Disick hopes so, as we\u2019ve heard he\u2019ll gladly \u2018ghost\u2019 Sofia Richie if Kourt\u2019s single again.\n\nWhen Kourtney Kardashian, 38, deactivated her Instagram and her boyfriend, Younes Bendjima, 24, made his account private, many thought there was trouble in paradise between these two. While everything seems to be back to normal, Scott Disick, 34, certainly hopes something is up, as a source close to \u201cThe Lord\u201d EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com that he\u2019s praying \u201cthat Kourtney unfollowing Younes on social media is the beginning of the end for Kourtney and her boy toy. Scott has never stopped loving Kourtney and he always will.\u201d Uh-oh. Well, bad news for Scott: Kourt\u2019s back on the \u2018gram and following Younes.\n\nLooks like Scott\u2019s ready to swoop in the second Kourt\u2019s back on the market. Wait. What about Sofia Richie? Scott has had quite the love affair with the 19-year-old. They\u2019ve travelled the world and were even seen having lunch together a few weeks ago. Will Scott stay by Sofia\u2019s side if his baby mama suddenly becomes Younes-less? \u201cIf it turns out Kourtney is single again,\u201d the insider tells HollywoodLife.com, \u201cyou can bet that Scott will ghost Sofia and start spending more time at home with Kourt and the kids. As much fun as Scott has been having with Sofia, he still loves Kourt very much and would love to put his family back together.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s\u2026.actually a bit harsh for Sofia. Even if this romance with Scott is \u201cjust a phase,\u201d like her father Lionel Richie said it is, she doesn\u2019t deserve to get ghosted by Scott the moment Kourt is single. Plus, even if she and Younes have split, it\u2019s not like she\u2019s going to throw open the doors and welcome Scott (and all his problems) back in her life. \u201cThe Lord\u201d might want to take a hint and let go of those reconciliation dreams of his.\n\nAlso, with Scott ready to spend more with his ex and the kids, Sofia might want to hold on making any long-term plans with her current boyfriend. \u201cScott has been in a lot of pain since Kourt began sleeping with Younes,\u201d the insider added, \u201cand he\u2019s has been waiting for the day that she deletes him from social media. Scott is hopeful that this as a major sign that it\u2019s the beginning of the end for Kourt and Younes.\u201d", "images": ["https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/the-db-method-review.gif?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/kelly-rowland-felt-overshadowed-by-beyonce-ap-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/scott-ghost_sofia-ftr.jpg", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/swat-fall-premiere-season-4.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/palm-springs-watch-hulu.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/jason_brow.jpg?w=48", "https://i1.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-26-at-6.04.30-PM.png?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/scott-ghost_sofia-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/quarantine-makes-me-realize-just-how-important-my-mom-friends-are.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/padma_bikini-90-minute-workout-that-tones-her-abs-splashnews-ftr-2.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/halle-berry-celebrates-20th-xmen-anniversary-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/scott-ghost_sofia-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jason Brow", "Sabrina Rojas Weiss", "Nikki Brown", "Dave Nemetz", "Tim Chan", "Tom Brueggemann", "Music", "Sports Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/03/06/scott-disick-kourtney-kardashian-deleting-instagram-younes-bendjima/", "title": "Scott Disick Ready To Ghost Sofia Richie For Kourtney Kardashian If She\u2019s Split From Younes Bendjima", "meta_data": {"description": "Kourtney Kardashian deleting her Instagram gave Scott Disick hope that she split from Younes, as he's ready to swoop in if she's single.", "news_keywords": "Kourtney Kardashian, Scott Disick, Sofia Richie", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Scott Disick Ready To Ghost Sofia Richie For Kourtney Kardashian If She\u2019s Split From Younes Bendjima", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/03/06/scott-disick-kourtney-kardashian-deleting-instagram-younes-bendjima/", "description": "Does Kourtney Kardashian and Younes Bendjima\u2019s social media snafu meant they\u2019re on the rocks?

Even though rumors are swirling he is ready to wed Gwen Stefani, Shelton has been throwing shade at Lambert online. And, according to industry insiders, the feud between the country superstars is escalating. But, Lambert isn\u2019t going to quietly put up with Shelton\u2019s attacks anymore.\n\nAfter the news of Lambert\u2019s new relationship broke, Shelton posted a cryptic tweet about karma, and sources say it was exactly what everyone thought it was \u2013 a direct shot at Lambert. And, it appears that The Voice coach is getting a lot of joy out of Lambert\u2019s embarrassment because for him this is personal.\n\n@blakeshelton #countrymusicfreakstour gx A post shared by Gwen Stefani (@gwenstefani) on Mar 14, 2018 at 3:28pm PDT\n\n\u201cBlake is reveling in Miranda\u2019s humiliation now that she\u2019s been accused of having an affair with a married man because he believes she cheated on him,\u201d claims the insider.\n\nEven though they have been apart for three years, sources say the feud continues between Shelton and Lambert, and he believes that she will never change. The 41-year-old believes in the \u201conce a cheater always a cheater\u201d theory.\n\nThe Hollywood Gossip is reporting that Shelton thinks that his ex is the same person she has always been and that includes her \u201ctwisted relationship antics.\u201d\n\nThe country community basically sided with Shelton after the split, but he apparently feels like he came off as the villain. Reports claimed that he filed for divorce back in 2015 and she came home to find all of her things outside of their Oklahoma house. Because of that, many made him out to be the bad guy. But, even though he feels Lambert \u201cplayed the victim,\u201d he thought he had a good reason to send Lambert packing.\n\nNow, Shelton thinks the Tin Man singer is getting exactly what she deserves, and if she is embarrassed about the allegations that she ran off with another woman\u2019s husband, then it is \u201csweet justice.\u201d\n\nMiranda Lambert's Ex Says She Cheated With Blake Shelton (via @Fox411) https://t.co/Xy5a8tjtkJ \u2014 TMZ (@TMZ) May 1, 2018\n\nHowever, calling it justice may be a bit much, considering the fact that Shelton admitted to falling in love with Lambert while he was still married to his first wife. One source even calls him a \u201chypocrite.\u201d\n\nLambert still denies that she ever cheated on Shelton, and she also doesn\u2019t believe she had anything to do with the breakup of Felker\u2019s marriage. So, she won\u2019t be sitting around and taking Shelton\u2019s jabs much longer. Insiders say it is only a matter of time before she retaliates and return fire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSources say that the divorce deeply shook both Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton and it doesn\u2019t appear either one will ever get over it. They will apparently be \u201ctrading insults, put-downs, and breakup songs for a long time to come.\u201d", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Blake-Shelton-And-Miranda-Lambert-At-War-Their-Feud-Is-Nastier-Than-Fans-Even-Know.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jimmy-fallon-returns-to-the-studio-for-the-tonight-show-but-with-major-changes-300x210.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/maxresdefault-1-3-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Gwen-Stefani-Blake-Shelton-Two-Weddings-700x466.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/melaniat-trump-face-mask-300x214.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/avatar_user_36_1498683898-60x60.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2060%2060%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2042%2042%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%2035%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201000%20700%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Tamar-Braxton-Vincent-Herbert-Marriage-700x466.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/235dba45d41beb4759bb22705b6ec3c0?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/moore-brooklyn-300x158.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/courtney-stodden-has-no-time-for-f-boys-300x220.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gavin-gwen-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Miranda-Lambert-and-Brendan-McLouglin-Ice-Cream-Truck-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/counting-on-did-jill-duggar-accidentally-reveal-shes-pregnant-with-baby-number-three-in-her-latest-instagram-post_-300x210.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/donald-trump-2-300x200.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%2027%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/kandi-burruss8217-new-8216speak-on-it8217-episode-is-out-and-addresses-another-issue-involving-todd-tucker8217s-daughter-kaela-82-300x216.jpg"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Blake-Shelton-And-Miranda-Lambert-At-War-Their-Feud-Is-Nastier-Than-Fans-Even-Know.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Suzy Kerr", "Angie Williamson", "Angela Williamson"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/blake-shelton-and-miranda-lambert-at-war-their-feud-is-nastier-than-fans-even-know-144114/", "title": "Blake Shelton And Miranda Lambert At War!

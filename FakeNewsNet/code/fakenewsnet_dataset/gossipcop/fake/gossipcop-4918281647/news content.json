I\u2019m very proud of her for that, for the way she handles herself,\" he told The Sunday Times.\n\nEarlier this year, Aniston wrote a powerful piece about body shaming and pregnancy pressures for The Huffington Post. Theroux showed his support of the opinion piece by sharing the link to it on his Instagram page with the caption: #wcw Here's just one reason why.\n\n#wcw Here's just one reason why. http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_57855586e4b03fc3ee4e626f #gogirl A photo posted by @justintheroux on Jul 13, 2016 at 5:25am PDT\n\nIn his sit-down interview with The Sunday Times, the 45-year-old \"Leftovers\" star went on to call his wife a \"proper badass\" adding, \"it\u2019s an honour to stand behind her.\"\n\nDespite having his own successful career as an actor, director, and screenwriter, Theroux is often referred to as \"Mr. Jennifer Aniston\" in the media, but he doesn't look at the nickname as an insult that others may take it to be.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really get under my skin. It\u2019s just one of those things that\u2019s a shorthand for describing who I am,\u201d he explained.\n\nAniston and Theroux first met back in 2007 on the set of \"Tropic Thunder,\" which Theroux co-wrote with her \"Along Came Polly\" costar Ben Stiller. They went on to star in \"Wanderlust\" together in 2010 and officially came out as a couple in 2011, US magazine reports.\n\nAlso on HuffPost", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f08d7cf2200005e07386cde.png?cache=iozPCrfk3O&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f0bc2dc2200000b08386dd2.jpeg?cache=J3z1BkouiU&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f0dba371f00001d0a33803f.jpeg?cache=e6WsfaXjGh&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cd638912100005800c42fd3.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f0ca8d51f0000c109337f8c.jpeg?cache=D7gPTwt4jX&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5efb721e220000970338637c.png?ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ef9ffe52200005701386201.jpeg?cache=hv4Su7NWSV&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f0dc5921f0000ba0a338051.png?cache=rDkCmGiOYY&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f0dfc702200007909386fa1.png?cache=yPkLxEXPq6&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5efdcd42270000cb04e6623e.jpeg?cache=t2d7A1D0Fg&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cd638912100005800c42fd4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f079e172500003307c29803.jpeg?cache=NBIrZuALFD&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ef53fef1f00001001337001.png?cache=MTW3ym0ca6&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f0ddfd3220000040a386f91.png?cache=KBbfmduMBk&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f0da4a9220000040a386f3d.jpeg?cache=iUHL3Lllw9&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cd635062400005900724b0a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f0e122e1f00007f0a3380aa.jpeg?cache=XMntgxYuFV&ops=434_244"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cd638912100005800c42fd3.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joy D'Souza"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/10/07/justin-theroux-jennifer-a_n_12387950.html", "title": "Justin Theroux Is Proud To Stand Behind Jennifer Aniston", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffingtonpost.ca", "locale": "en-CA", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "description": "\"It\u2019s an honour to stand behind her.\"", "keywords": "jen aniston justin theroux,Jenifer Aniston Proper Badass,jennifer aniston and justin theroux,Jennifer aniston career,jennifer aniston husband,jennifer aniston Justin Theroux,jennifer aniston justin theroux photos,Justin Theroux,justin theroux jennifer aniston,Justin Theroux Proud of Jennifer Aniston,Justin Theroux quotes on Jennifer Aniston,Justin Theroux talks Jennifer Aniston,justin theroux the leftovers,Justing Theroux Mr Jennifer Aniston,living,video", "og": {"title": "Justin Theroux Doesn't Mind Being Called Mr. Jennifer Aniston", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cd638912100005800c42fd3.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cd638912100005800c42fd3.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/10/07/justin-theroux-jennifer-a_n_12387950.html", "site_name": "HuffPost Canada", "locale": "en_CA", "description": "\"It\u2019s an honour to stand behind her.\""}, "article": {"tag": "jen aniston justin theroux,Jenifer Aniston Proper Badass,jennifer aniston and justin theroux,Jennifer aniston career,jennifer aniston husband,jennifer aniston Justin Theroux,jennifer aniston justin theroux photos,Justin Theroux,justin theroux jennifer aniston,Justin Theroux Proud of Jennifer Aniston,Justin Theroux quotes on Jennifer Aniston,Justin Theroux talks Jennifer Aniston,justin theroux the leftovers,Justing Theroux Mr Jennifer Aniston,living,video", "section": "Life", "published_time": "2016-10-07T15:49:14Z", "modified_time": "2016-10-07T15:50:12Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostCaLife", "title": "Justin Theroux Doesn't Mind Being Called Mr. Jennifer Aniston", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cd638912100005800c42fd3.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "description": "\"It\u2019s an honour to stand behind her.\""}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=ca&entryID=ca_5cd63891e4b070c4ba478e4c", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "robots": "max-snippet:-1,max-image-preview:standard,max-video-preview:-1", "taboola.category": "living"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1475778600.0, "source": "http://www.huffingtonpost.ca", "summary": ""}

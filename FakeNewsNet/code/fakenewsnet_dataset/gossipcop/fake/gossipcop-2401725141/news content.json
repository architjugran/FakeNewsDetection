Iconic pop couple Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake are allegedly set to collaborate on a song together according to superstar producer Timbaland!\n\nMORE: Britney Spears\u2019 Hot Boyfriend Sam Asghari\u2019s Bulge Is Making Us Want a Piece of Him\n\nAccording to the hosts of the podcast Pop University, who attended a taping of the new show Boy Band on which Timbaland is a star. Seizing the opportunity, Maddie Lazer and Hannah Rowston, the hosts of the podcast, went up to the 45-year-old producer to get the low down on the possibility of a \u201cJustney\u201d collab.\n\n(Photo Credit: Getty Images)\n\nWhen they finally got to ask Timbaland if he and the \u201890s pop icons were going to be creating new tunes together, he pretty much confirmed. \u201cYes, it\u2019s coming,\u201d he told them. \u201cIt\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\nRumors of a collaboration have been swirling for a while now. Just last year, while answering fan questions in a Q&A, the mother-of-two hinted at the desire to collaborate with her former love. J.T. too has expressed some interest in working alongside the Pop Princess. When asked by E! News as to whether or not he would reconnect with the blonde beauty he said, \u201cShe [wants to collaborate]? Sure! Absolutely, absolutely.\u201d\n\nMORE: Did Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera Record a Duet?

Even Justin\u2019s former bandmate Lance Bass expressed his excitement for the reported impending collab.\n\n\u201cI would love to see that happen, of course. I think everyone in the world wants to see them together again in any capacity. It\u2019s like everyone\u2019s childhood dream,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it would be an incredible collaboration. I would want it to be a dance number, though. I want them to both\u2014kinda like that Michael-Janet [Jackson] type thing, would be incredible.\u201d\n\nAll we can say is that we are anxiously awaiting. And we hope they\u2019ve already bought their denim outfits!", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/britney-spears-justin-timberlake.jpg?w=1180&h=500&crop=1", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/justin-timberlake-britney-spears.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/britney-spears-abs-1999.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Jamie-and-Doug-Season-1-MAFS.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C750px%2C750px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Farrah-Abraham-Says-Her-Upcoming-Shows-Will-Be-Culturally-Diverse.jpg?crop=47px%2C0px%2C1835px%2C1040px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Aaron-Hernandez-Jailhouse-Lover-Claims-He-Was-Guilty-of-Double-Murder.jpg?crop=66px%2C0px%2C1534px%2C869px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/justin-timberlake-britney-spears.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Duggar-Girls-Wearing-Pants-and-Jeans.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/britneys-spears-stage.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/When-Does-Ridiculousness-Come-Back-Chanel-West-Coast-Reveals.jpg?crop=0px%2C44px%2C2151px%2C1219px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Meghan-Markle-Hated-Royal-Dress-Code-Shes-Much-More-Comfortable-Wearing-Casual-Clothes.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/naya-rivera-denim-outfit.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3271px%2C1852px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Farrah-Abraham-Says-Sophia-Craves-Getting-Know-Her-Dad-Family.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IT2319_cover_cn3_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Farrah-Abraham-Would-Be-Open-to-Reuniting-With-Her-Fellow-Teen-Mom-Stars.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Who-Are-Kobe-Bryants-Wife-and-Kids.jpg?crop=0px%2C69px%2C3150px%2C3150px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chanel-West-Coasts-Calls-Costars-Rob-Dyrdek-and-Sterling-Steelo-Brim-Family.jpg?crop=0px%2C8px%2C1976px%2C1119px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/REELZ-Profiles-Olivia-Newton-John-Health-Crisis-in-Tell-All-Special-01.jpg?crop=246px%2C0px%2C1522px%2C861px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-27-at-4.09.35-PM.png?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Lost-Resort-cast-2.jpg?resize=120%2C68"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/justin-timberlake-britney-spears.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jeryl Lippe"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/britney-spears-justin-timberlake-collaboration-139386/", "title": "Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake Set to Collaborate on New Music (REPORT)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "It\u2019s the moment every \u201890s girl has been waiting for.

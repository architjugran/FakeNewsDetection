Anna Wintour has a net worth of $50 million. Her annual salary as Editor of Vogue is $4 million. She is considered one of the most influential figures in the fashion industry. She served as the (albeit not very flattering) inspiration for the popular novel and movie The Devil Wears Prada.\n\nHer career began in the world of fashion before moving into journalism, largely at the behest of her parents. Her father Charles Wintour was the editor of the London Evening Standard for nearly two decades.\n\nIn 1970, Wintour was hired on as an editorial assistant for the new Harper's & Queen fashion magazine. Even at this early stage of her career, Wintour divulged to coworkers that she had the desire to edit Vogue, a desire that would grow to be fulfilled nearly 20 years later. Wintour introduced sweeping changes to Vogue from her first issue forward. Many of these changes could be seen right on the cover. Wintour favored more naturalistic photography of lesser-known models outside, as opposed to the tight headshots the magazine had previously favored. Additionally, Wintour's first Vogue cover was also the first to feature a model wearing jeans, with the added bonus of wearing a bejeweled T-shirt valued at around $10,000. Under Wintour, Vogue has continued to be one of the pillars of fashion journalism.", "images": ["http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1057081139/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1471602713096627&ev=NoScript", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Anna-Wintour-e1591569843794.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7516694&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Anna-Wintour-e1591569843794.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-businessmen/richest-designers/anna-wintour-net-worth/", "title": "Anna Wintour Net Worth", "meta_data": {"description": "Anna Wintour Net Worth and Salary: Anna Wintour is an American magazine editor and fashion news icon.

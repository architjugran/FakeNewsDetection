Although it hasn\u2019t been perfect, they gave Miley some amazing advice on her relationship to Liam Hemsworth!\n\nFirst of all, can we talk about how amazing Miley Cyrus looks in the new issue of Cosmopolitan? For their September issue, Miley brought the magazine to her family farm, and the photo shoot is a representation of her country upbringing. On the cover, she\u2019s posing in jean overalls while seductively licking an ice cube and holding a red mason jar. She\u2019s got her ombre hair curled in a retro style and a bold red lip. Her eyes are so bright and blue! Inside, she\u2019s laying on a pile of hay, rocking a bright blue, floral bodysuit. She looks amazing!\n\nOn what she has learned from her parents about marriage, Miley says: \u201cNothing and no one stays the same. Grow, evolve, change with each other and celebrate your love\u2019s journey!\u201d Surely that advice comes in handy when she\u2019s thinking about her relationship with Liam Hemsworth, whom she met and fell in love with on the set of their movie The Last Song in 2009. Miley is super close with her big family, so we\u2019re sure everyone is always exchanging pieces of advice!\n\nMiley also spoke about her favorite red carpet moments (\u201c2015 VMAs! Versace!\u201d) and her red carpet regrets! \u201cMy least favorite look: Pretty much 2008-2013. The Grammys were rough and tough for me. Yoikes!\u201d\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Miley Cyrus\u2019 relationship advice is good? We can\u2019t wait to see her marry Liam Hemsworth!", "images": ["https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/miley-cyrus-cosmo-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/the-db-method-review.gif?resize=230%2C135", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/swat-fall-premiere-season-4.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/gigi-hadid-strapless-bikini-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/dory_zayas.jpg?w=48", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/miley-cyrus-cosmo-embed.jpg?w=620&h=856", "https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/palm-springs-watch-hulu.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://i1.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-26-at-6.04.30-PM.png?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/quarantine-makes-me-realize-just-how-important-my-mom-friends-are.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/naya-rivera-cause-of-death-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/halle-berry-celebrates-20th-xmen-anniversary-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/miley-cyrus-cosmo-ftr.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/miley-cyrus-cosmo-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dory Larrabee-Zayas", "Sabrina Rojas Weiss", "Nikki Brown", "Dave Nemetz", "Tim Chan", "Tom Brueggemann", "Lifestyle Director"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/08/02/miley-cyrus-relationship-advice-liam-hemsworth-parents-marriage-cosmopolitan-cover/", "title": "Miley Cyrus: Her Parents\u2019 Advice On Her Future Wedding To Liam Hemsworth", "meta_data": {"description": "Miley Cyrus got some relationship advice for her future marriage to Liam Hemsworth from her parents -- read it below.", "news_keywords": "Billy Ray Cyrus, Cosmo magazine, Cosmopolitan Magazine, Liam Hemsworth, Miley Cyrus", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Miley Cyrus: Her Parents\u2019 Advice On Her Future Wedding To Liam Hemsworth", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/08/02/miley-cyrus-relationship-advice-liam-hemsworth-parents-marriage-cosmopolitan-cover/", "description": "Miley Cyrus\u2019 parents Tish and Billy Ray have been together for more than 20 years.

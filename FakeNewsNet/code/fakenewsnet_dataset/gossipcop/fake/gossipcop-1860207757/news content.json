However, a representative for Jenner denied Halperin\u2019s claims, telling New York Daily News, \u201cNot worth commenting on such an idiotic report \u2026 Of course it\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been easy for Caitlyn, it\u2019s been very hard,\u201d the friend said, according to Halperin. \u201cShe\u2019s thrilled she has raised awareness about how transgender people have long been discriminated against but I think there\u2019s a chance she\u2019ll de-transition in the next couple years. I don\u2019t think it would surprise anybody in her inner circle. It has been much harder than she anticipated. My heart goes out to her and I know her true friends will be there to support her on whatever path she chooses.\u201d\n\nAccording to Halperin, multiple sources close to the Kardashian family told him that Jenner might revert back because she retains her interest in females.\n\nAlso Read: Stop Asking Caitlyn Jenner to Be 'Transgender Bernie Sanders,' LGBT Activist Says\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s still into women and wants to meet the right one,\u201d Halperin recalled one friend saying.\n\nBased on his research, Halperin believes that Jenner will de-transition in the next couple of years, telling the public how difficult the transition was, but noting that she was happy to help raise awareness about transgender right.\n\nJenner has hinted at trepidation over the transition in the past. A lengthy Vanity Fair story recalls a panic attack that she experienced after undergoing facial-feminization surgery, during which she wondered, \u201cWhat did I just do? What did I just do to myself?\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Caitlyn Jenner 'Transparent' Casting Sparks Fan Riot on Twitter\n\nIn his book, the #1 New York Times best-selling author and award-winning journalist reveals that Jenner\u2019s ex-wife, Kris Jenner, was very aware of her husband\u2019s desire to transition, and forced him into religious conversion therapy, and attempted to get him to attend church in an effort to save their marriage.", "images": ["http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/get-more.svg",

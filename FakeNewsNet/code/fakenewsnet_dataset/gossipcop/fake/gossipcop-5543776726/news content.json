Is the couple ready to take the next step in their relationship?\n\n\u201cBrad cannot get enough of her and he thinks the next step is having her meet his children,\u201d claims an insider.\n\nThe source also said that Oxman \u2013 an MIT professor \u2013 \u201cwears the pants in their relationship,\u201d but Pitt doesn\u2019t have a problem with that. The 54-year-old is telling friends that his is in love and his sexual chemistry with Oxman is \u201coff the hook.\u201d\n\nPitt split with Angelina Jolie back in September 2016 and the two are still trying to reach a settlement in their divorce and a custody agreement for Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, Knox, 9, and Vivienne, 9. Pitt wants to be certain that there are provisions in the custody agreement that will make sure he gets custodial time with all of his kids.\n\nBrad Pitt & Angelina Jolie are still having custody issues. https://t.co/SXSj5Mq8cH \u2014 Perez Hilton (@PerezHilton) May 25, 2018\n\nTo make things easier on the kids, Jolie bought a house near Pitt\u2019s, but sources say that the actress has been hesitant to make a custody agreement with her ex because he has essentially forced her to settle down in L.A. with their children.\n\nThe Ocean\u2019s 11 star decided to rearrange his schedule and take a project in Los Angeles this summer, so he could spend as much time as possible with the Jolie-Pitt brood, and Oxman is traveling back and forth between her home in Massachusetts and his house in California.\n\nThe two are still \u201cvery much in each other\u2019s lives,\u201d but Pitt would like to see Oxman more. However, she has her own life in Boston, so they will have to settle for long-distance at the moment.\n\n\u201cHe said if you ever make her feel uncomfortable again, I\u2019ll kill you.\" The 1st rule of Fight Club is you don't talk about Fight Club. The 2nd rule of Fight Club is Brad Pitt is awesome.#MeToohttps://t.co/UzCMF40FGd \u2014 Greg Morelli (@yesgregyes) May 24, 2018\n\nThis arrangement may be working for Pitt and Oxman, but some reports claim that Jolie is not happy because she can\u2019t bring the kids with her to London this summer while she films Maleficent 2. Pitt wants the kids in Los Angeles and to see them on the regular custody schedule. He is not okay with them being gone for an extended period of time. He believes it is best for them to stay home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut still, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie continue to try and work out a custody agreement and divorce settlement that they both can be happy with, but insiders say the two remain at odds.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Brad-Pitt-Is-Reportedly-Ready-For-Neri-Oxman-To-Meet-His-Kids-How-Will-Angelina-Jolie-React.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/amber-heard-bollywoodtrendz-blogspot-com-300x225.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/brad-pitt-and-alia-shawkat-engaged-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/maxresdefault-1-3-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/john-legend-theboombox-com_-300x200.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/avatar_user_36_1498683898-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/porsha-williams-300x200.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2060%2060%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2042%2042%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Norman-Reedus-Scores-20-Million-For-Season-10-Of-The-Walking-Dead-As-News-Breaks-He-And-Diana-Kruger-Are-Expecting-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/angelina-jolie-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%2035%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201000%20700%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/angelina-jolie-zahara-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/moore-brooklyn-300x158.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/courtney-stodden-has-no-time-for-f-boys-300x220.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ghislaine-maxwell-nypost-com_-300x200.jpeg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%2027%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/kandi-burruss8217-new-8216speak-on-it8217-episode-is-out-and-addresses-another-issue-involving-todd-tucker8217s-daughter-kaela-82-300x216.jpg"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Brad-Pitt-Is-Reportedly-Ready-For-Neri-Oxman-To-Meet-His-Kids-How-Will-Angelina-Jolie-React.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Suzy Kerr", "Delores Perry", "Angie Williamson", "Angela Williamson"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/brad-pitt-is-reportedly-ready-for-neri-oxman-to-meet-his-kids-how-will-angelina-jolie-react-152856/", "title": "Brad Pitt Is Reportedly Ready For Neri Oxman To Meet His Kids!

But he is always obsessed with design and wants to get a pet that is beautiful, stylish and moves great.\n\nA rep for Pitt also laughed off the tail, er, tale.\n\nBrad Pitt is getting a dog for companionship, according to a tabloid that is seemingly unaware he already has a dog. To exactly no one\u2019s surprise, Gossip Cop can confirm this latest story about the actor was made-up.The piece in question can be found in the new edition of the National Enquirer, under the headline, \u201cBrad Panting Over Dog!\u201d The article begins by asserting the \u201clonely\u201d Pitt is \u201con the hunt for a furry new friend!\u201d A purported \u201ctop breeder\u201d is quoted as saying, \u201cBrad has been searching for a dog.\u201cHe seems to have narrowed his search down to a poodle or a Portuguese water dog,\u201d continues the gossip magazine\u2019s supposed tipster. While that may sound plausible, particularly since Pitt\u2019s interest in design is well-known, the sourcing here is fishy. This alleged information comes from a purported \u201ctop breeder,\u201d but the actor likely wouldn\u2019t be working with a specific breeder yet if he doesn\u2019t know which kind of dog he wants. Though standard poodles and Portuguese water dogs are considered somewhat similar canines, responsible breeders typically specialize in a single breed.What\u2019s most strange is that nowhere does the outlet acknowledge that Pitt already has a pooch, and one that\u2019s very different from poodles and Portuguese water dogs. The actor\u2019s longtime pet is a bulldog, and the dog was actually mentioned multiple times in Pitt\u2019s GQ cover story from earlier this year. In fact, Newsweek went as far as declaring Jacques was the \u201cbest thing\u201d about the interview. Yet here\u2019s the National Enquirer acting like he doesn\u2019t even have a dog and suddenly needs to get one to stem his loneliness. Of course, it\u2019s not out of the realm of possibility for Pitt to add another canine to his home, but that\u2019s not even what the tabloid is claiming.Frankly, the supermarket tabloid has a lot of nerve claiming it knows anything about the star at all, after last year falsely accusing Pitt of beating Angelina Jolie and their kids. The magazine even doctored a photo to give Jolie a fake bruised appearance. It takes a lot of gall to write about Pitt, even on subjects as seemingly innocuous as getting a dog, after telling outright lies like that. And, for the record, Gossip Cop is told that no breeder legitimately connected to the actor leaked any real details about him getting a dog to this magazine.", "images": ["http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/avatars/gallery/newimages/eye5.gif", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/n/naya-rivera-b028205c8cc236bdbad87f43943736944f22d525.jpg", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/eusa_dance.gif", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/square/250/f/ffagony-auntarticle.jpg", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/m/miriam-margolyes-6a71c5cb2aaf6573bed61eeb46bb822136fc294e.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/m/marmageddon-new-zealand-in-marmite-crisis-a69955440fb813105b2256cdc77e8d80fb0c9b8d", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/download/file.php?avatar=282476_1492473517.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/f/ferrari-2e9f6b5d8ae121612e1a361e359163ffb7b5a500.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/d/dying-man-installs-coffin-at-his-home-f1f790cd90c5f7ed02ade3.jpg", "https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/48/60/ac/4860aca094a071526dbf4357b598acc6.jpg", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif", "http://starschanges.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-pets-dog-Jacques-and-2-pugs-2.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/o/olivia-culpo-for-sports-illustrated-a7b9502e2488c79a1411b45e.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/square/250/p/past-tools-kit-and-bowls.jpg", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif", "https://a.collective-media.net/seg/etu/1b", "http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/assets/gfx/ff/logos/femalefirst.png", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/3/3m-long-great-white-eaten-3d3a3589edd92ff9a8ad43941775747df9.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/square/250/l/leapfrog-shapes-and-sharing-picnic-basket.jpg", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/download/file.php?avatar=280654_1477579529.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/48/60/ac/4860aca094a071526dbf4357b598acc6.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/viewtopic.php?t=749076", "title": "Female First Forum", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk", "summary": ""}

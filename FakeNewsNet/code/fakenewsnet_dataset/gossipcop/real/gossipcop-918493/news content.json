For example, during the ceremony, last night, Tiffany Haddish \u2013 the Girls Trip star \u2013 jumped over the velvet rope to meet Meryl.\n\nIn an interview with E! News, Mary J Blige, the actress, and singer, spoke with Zuri Hall and revealed what her favorite part of the event was. According to the singer, who is going through a divorce right now, the most exciting part has nothing to do with the nominations.\n\nMary said, for her, the best moment was meeting and seeing people that she\u2019s always wanted to meet. She said, \u201cI saw some of the cast from Black Panther, which made me excited.\u201d\n\nMary added that it was a real honor to meet Chadwick Boseman as well as Lupita Nyong\u2019O. Blige claimed the new Black Panther meant a lot to her and possibly even the culture at large.\n\nWhen Zuri asked her if she would like to star in a movie such as Black Panther, Mary said, \u201cI hope so!\u201d Last night, Mary received two Academy Award nominations for the first time.\n\nMary was on the red carpet because of her performance of the track, \u201cMighty River,\u201d in the movie Mudbound, a song which received critical acclaim on varying levels.\n\nAnd while Mary was excited to speak with reporters, her mind was focused elsewhere. Admittedly, Blige was in a hurry to mingle with other celebs. She said, \u201cOk, enough talking. I\u2019m going to go party now!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to talking with reporters, Blige was spotted at Vanity Fair\u2019s after-party along with Sean Combs and Kobe Bryant. The threesome posed for a photograph together.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tory-lanez-reqcartier-wordpress-com_-300x200.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201245%20700%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/maxresdefault-1-3-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paris-jackson-1-300x300.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2060%2060%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Mary-J-Blige-KRVS.com_-e1520279931989.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2042%2042%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mary-J-Blige-Tiny-Harris-Fit-Body-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Sterling-K.-Brown-LaineyGossip.com--700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Fanatic-Con.com_-700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/50-cent-xxlmag-com_-1-300x200.jpeg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%2035%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/moore-brooklyn-300x158.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ToddMalm-60x60.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kendall-jenner-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/courtney-stodden-has-no-time-for-f-boys-300x220.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/scott-baio-and-donald-trump-300x215.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%2027%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/kandi-burruss8217-new-8216speak-on-it8217-episode-is-out-and-addresses-another-issue-involving-todd-tucker8217s-daughter-kaela-82-300x216.jpg"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Mary-J-Blige-KRVS.com_-e1520279931989.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Todd Malm", "Delores Perry", "Angie Williamson", "Angela Williamson"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/mary-j-blige-claims-she-wants-to-do-a-superhero-movie-following-the-release-of-black-panther-122309/", "title": "Mary J Blige Claims She Wants To Do A Superhero Movie Following The Release Of Black Panther", "meta_data": {"author": "Todd Malm", "news_keywords": "black panther, mary j blige", "keywords": "celebrity news, black panther, mary j blige", "p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "theme-color": "#dedede", "description": "Last night's Academy Awards was an incredible event, so much so that even celebrities themselves found themselves star-struck by people like Meryl", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Mary J Blige Claims She Wants To Do A Superhero Movie Following The Release Of Black Panther", "description": "Last night's Academy Awards was an incredible event, so much so that even celebrities themselves found themselves star-struck by people like Meryl", "url": "https://celebrityinsider.org/mary-j-blige-claims-she-wants-to-do-a-superhero-movie-following-the-release-of-black-panther-122309/", "image": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Mary-J-Blige-KRVS.com_-e1520279931989.jpg", "site_name": "Breaking Celebrity News, Entertainment News, and Celebrity Gossip - Celebrity Insider"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-05", "modified_time": "2018-03-05", "author": "https://celebrityinsider.org/author/toddmalm/", "section": "Hollywood", "tag": "mary j blige"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1646073299040160}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@CelebInsiderorg", "site": "@CelebInsiderorg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cropped-favincon-270x270.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520188200.0, "source": "http://celebrityinsider.org", "summary": ""}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "text": "American singer, dancer, and actress\n\nBritney Jean Spears (born December 2, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and actress. She is credited with influencing the revival of teen pop during the late 1990s and early 2000s, for which she is referred to as the \"Princess of Pop\".\n\nBorn in McComb, Mississippi and raised in Kentwood, Louisiana, she appeared in stage productions and television series before signing with Jive Records in 1997. Spears's first two studio albums, ...Baby One More Time (1999) and Oops!... I Did It Again (2000), were global successes and made her the best-selling teenage artist of all time. Spears adopted more mature and provocative themes for her next two studio albums, Britney (2001) and In the Zone (2003), and made her feature film debut in a starring role in Crossroads (2002). Following a series of heavily publicized personal struggles and erratic public behavior beginning in 2006, Spears's career was interrupted, before the release of her fifth studio album Blackout (2007), which is often critically referred to as her best work.[1] Spears' personal struggles led her to be placed on a still ongoing conservatorship. She returned to the top of record charts with her sixth and seventh studio albums, Circus (2008) and Femme Fatale (2011), respectively. In 2012, Forbes reported that Spears was the highest paid female musician of the year, with earnings of $58 million, having last topped the list in 2002.[2] During the promotion of her eighth and ninth studio albums, Britney Jean (2013) and Glory (2016), Spears embarked on a four-year concert residency, Britney: Piece of Me, at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino in Las Vegas. In 2019, Spears announced an indefinite career hiatus and was later admitted involuntarily into a mental health facility by her conservator, leading to a court-led investigation into malpractice conducted by her team.\n\nSpears has scored six solo number one albums on the Billboard 200, making her the third best performing female artist on the chart.[3] Four of Spears's singles have reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100: \"...Baby One More Time\", \"Womanizer\", \"3\", and \"Hold It Against Me\". Other singles, \"Oops!... I Did It Again\", \"Toxic\", and \"Scream & Shout\", topped the charts in most countries. With \"3\" in 2009 and \"Hold It Against Me\" in 2011, she became the second artist after Mariah Carey in the Hot 100's history to debut at number one with two or more songs. Spears has earned numerous awards and accolades, including a Grammy Award; seven Guinness World Records; six MTV Video Music Awards, including the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award; seven Billboard Music Awards, including the Millennium Award;[4] the inaugural Radio Disney Icon Award; and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[5]\n\nBillboard ranked her as the eighth-biggest artist of the 2000s decade.[6] One of the world's best-selling music artists, Spears is regarded as a pop icon and has sold 100 million records worldwide, including over 70 million records in the United States.[7][8] In the United States, Spears is the fourth best-selling female album artist of the Nielsen SoundScan era[9] as well as the best-selling female album artist of the 2000s.[10][11][12] In 2004, Spears launched a perfume brand with Elizabeth Arden, Inc.; sales exceeded US$1.5 billion as of 2012 .[13] Spears has topped the list of most searched celebrities seven times in 12 years, a record since the inception of the internet.[14]\n\nLife and career\n\n1981\u20131997: Early life and career beginnings\n\nBritney Jean Spears was born on December 2, 1981 in McComb, Mississippi,[15][16] the second child of Lynne Irene Bridges and James Parnell Spears. Her maternal grandmother, Lillian Portell, was English (born in London), and one of Spears's maternal great-great-grandfathers was Maltese.[17] Her siblings are Bryan James and Jamie Lynn Spears.[18] She was born in the Bible Belt, where socially conservative evangelical Protestantism is a particularly strong religious influence;[19] Spears was baptized as a Southern Baptist and sang in a church choir as a child.[20] As an adult, she has studied Kabbalist teachings.[21]\n\nAt age three, she started attending dance lessons in her hometown of Kentwood, Louisiana, and was selected to perform as a solo artist at the annual recital. Spears made her local stage debut at age five, singing \"What Child Is This?\" at her kindergarten graduation. During her childhood, she also had gymnastics and voice lessons, and won many state-level competitions and children's talent shows.[22][23][24] She said about her ambition as a child, \"I was in my own world, [...] I found out what I'm supposed to do at an early age\".[23]\n\nAt age eight, Spears and her mother Lynne traveled to Atlanta, Georgia to audition for the 1990s revival of The Mickey Mouse Club. Casting director Matt Casella rejected her as too young, but introduced her to Nancy Carson, a New York City talent agent. Carson was impressed with Spears's singing and suggested enrolling her at the Professional Performing Arts School; shortly after, Lynne and her daughters moved to a sublet apartment in New York.\n\nSpears was hired for her first professional role as the understudy for the lead role of Tina Denmark in the Off-Broadway musical Ruthless!. She also appeared as a contestant on the popular television show Star Search and was cast in a number of commercials.[25][26] In December 1992, she was cast in The Mickey Mouse Club alongside Christina Aguilera, Justin Timberlake, Ryan Gosling, and Keri Russell. After the show was canceled in 1996, she returned to Mississippi and enrolled at McComb's Parklane Academy. Although she made friends with most of her classmates, she compared the school to \"the opening scene in Clueless with all the cliques. [...] I was so bored. I was the point guard on the basketball team. I had my boyfriend, and I went to homecoming and Christmas formal. But I wanted more.\"[23][27]\n\nIn June 1997, Spears was in talks with manager Lou Pearlman to join the female pop group Innosense. Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer Larry Rudolph for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a Whitney Houston karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided that he wanted to pitch her to record labels, for which she needed a professional demo made. He sent Spears an unused song of Toni Braxton; she rehearsed for a week and recorded her vocals in a studio with a sound engineer. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met with executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three of the labels rejected her, saying that audiences wanted pop bands such as the Backstreet Boys and the Spice Girls, and \"there wasn't going to be another Madonna, another Debbie Gibson, or another Tiffany.\"[28]\n\nTwo weeks later, executives from Jive Records returned calls to Rudolph.[28] Senior vice president of A&R Jeff Fenster said about Spears's audition that \"it's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal...For any artist, the motivation\u2014the 'eye of the tiger'\u2014is extremely important. And Britney had that.\"[23] Spears sang Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" (1992) for the executives, and was subsequently signed to the label.[29] They appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month, who reportedly shaped her voice from \"lower and less poppy\" delivery to \"distinctively, unmistakably Britney.\"[30] After hearing the recorded material, president Clive Calder ordered a full album. Spears had originally envisioned \"Sheryl Crow music, but younger; more adult contemporary.\" She felt secure with her label's appointment of producers, since \"It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it\u2014it's more me.\"[23] She flew to Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, where half of the album was recorded from March to April 1998, with producers Max Martin, Denniz Pop and Rami Yacoub, among others.[23]\n\n1998\u20132000: ...Baby One More Time and Oops!... I Did It Again\n\nAfter Spears returned to the United States, she embarked on a shopping mall promotional tour to promote her upcoming debut album. Her show was a four-song set and she was accompanied by two back-up dancers. Her first concert tour followed, as an opening act for NSYNC.[31] Her debut studio album, ...Baby One More Time, was released on January 12, 1999.[23] It debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 and was certified two-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America after a month. Worldwide, the album topped the charts in fifteen countries and sold over 10 million copies in a year.[32] It became the biggest-selling album ever by a teenage artist.[24]\n\nThe title track was released as the lead single from the album. Originally, Jive Records wanted its music video to be animated; however, Spears rejected it, and suggested the final concept of a Catholic schoolgirl.[30] The single sold 500,000 copies on its first day, and peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, topping the chart for two consecutive weeks. It has sold more than 10 million copies, making it one of the best-selling singles of all time.[33][34] \"...Baby One More Time\" later received a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.[35] The title track also topped the singles chart for two weeks in the United Kingdom, and became the fastest-selling single ever by a female artist, shipping over 460,000 copies.[36] It would later become the 25th-most successful song of all time in British chart history.[37] Spears is the youngest female artist to have a million seller in the UK.[38] \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" was released as the third single from the album. It became a top-ten hit worldwide and further propelled the success of the ...Baby One More Time album. The album has sold 25 million copies worldwide,[39][40] making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. It is the best-selling debut album by any artist.[41][42][43]\n\nOn June 28, 1999, Spears began her first headlining ...Baby One More Time Tour in North America, which was positively received by critics.[44] It also generated some controversy due to her racy outfits.[45] An extension of the tour, titled Crazy 2k, followed in March 2000. Spears premiered songs from her upcoming second album during the show.[27]\n\nOops!... I Did It Again, her second studio album, was released in May 2000. It debuted at number one in the US, selling 1.3 million copies, breaking the Nielsen SoundScan record for the highest debut sales by any solo artist.[46] The album has sold over 20 million copies worldwide to date,[47] making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone said that \"the great thing about Oops! \u2013 under the cheese surface, Britney's demand for satisfaction is complex, fierce and downright scary, making her a true child of rock & roll tradition.\"[48] The album's lead single, \"Oops!... I Did It Again\", peaked at the top of the charts in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and many other European nations.[38][49] The album as well as the title track received Grammy nominations for Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, respectively.[50]\n\nThe same year, Spears embarked on the Oops!... I Did It Again Tour, which grossed $40.5 million; she also released her first book, Britney Spears' Heart to Heart, co-written with her mother.[24][51] On September 7, 2000, Spears performed at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards. Halfway through the performance, she ripped off her black suit to reveal a sequined flesh-colored bodysuit, followed by heavy dance routine. It is noted by critics as the moment that Spears showed signs of becoming a more provocative performer.[52] Amidst media speculation, Spears confirmed she was dating NSYNC member Justin Timberlake.[24] Spears and Timberlake would both graduate from high school via distance learning from the University of Nebraska High School.[53][54] She also bought a home in Destin, Florida.[55]\n\n2001\u20132002: Britney and Crossroads\n\nIn February 2001, Spears signed a $7\u20138 million promotional deal with Pepsi, and released another book co-written with her mother, titled A Mother's Gift.[24] Her self-titled third studio album, Britney, was released in November 2001. While on tour, she felt inspired by hip hop artists such as Jay-Z and The Neptunes and wanted to create a record with a funkier sound.[56] The album debuted at number one in the Billboard 200 and reached top five positions in Australia, the United Kingdom and mainland Europe and sold over 15 million copies worldwide.[38][57][58] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called Britney \"the record where she strives to deepen her persona, making it more adult while still recognizably Britney. [...] It does sound like the work of a star who has now found and refined her voice, resulting in her best record yet.\"[59] The album was honored with two Grammy nominations\u2014Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for \"Overprotected\"\u2014 and was listed in 2008 as one of Entertainment Weekly's \"100 Best Albums from the Past 25 Years\".[60][61] The album's first single, \"I'm a Slave 4 U\", became a top-ten hit worldwide.[62] Spears's performance of the single at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards featured a caged tiger (wrangled by Bhagavan Antle) and a large albino python draped over her shoulders.[63] It was harshly received by animal rights organization PETA, who claimed the animals were mistreated and scrapped plans for an anti-fur billboard that was to feature Spears.[52] Jocelyn Vena of MTV summarized Spears's performance at the ceremony, saying, \"draping herself in a white python and slithering around a steamy garden setting \u2013 surrounded by dancers in zebra and tiger outfits \u2013 Spears created one of the most striking visuals in the 27-year history of the show.\"[64]\n\nTo support the album, Spears embarked on the Dream Within a Dream Tour. The show was critically praised for its technical innovations, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance being a water screen that pumped two tons of water into the stage.[65][66] The tour grossed $43.7 million, becoming the second highest-grossing tour of 2002 by a female artist, behind Cher's Farewell Tour.[67] Her career success was highlighted by Forbes in 2002, as Spears was ranked the world's most powerful celebrity.[68] Spears also landed her first starring role in Crossroads, released in February 2002. Although the film was largely panned, critics praised Spears's acting and the film was a box office success.[69][70][71] Crossroads, which had a $12 million budget, went on to gross over $61.1 million worldwide.[71]\n\nIn June 2002, Spears opened her first restaurant, Nyla, in New York City, but terminated her relationship in November, citing mismanagement and \"management's failure to keep her fully apprised\".[72] In July 2002, Spears announced she would take a six-month break from her career; however, she went back into the studio in November to record her new album.[73] Spears's relationship with Justin Timberlake ended after three years. In December 2002, Timberlake released the song \"Cry Me a River\" as the second single from his solo debut album. The music video featured a Spears look-alike and fueled the rumors that she had been unfaithful to him.[74][75] As a response, Spears wrote the ballad \"Everytime\" with her backing vocalist and friend Annet Artani.[76] The same year, Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst said that he was in a relationship with Spears. However, Spears denied Durst's claims. In a 2009 interview, he explained that \"I just guess at the time it was taboo for a guy like me to be associated with a gal like her.\"[77]\n\n2003\u20132005: In the Zone and marriages\n\nSpears performing at the NFL Kickoff Live in September 2003\n\nIn August 2003, Spears opened the MTV Video Music Awards with Christina Aguilera, performing \"Like a Virgin\". Halfway through they were joined by Madonna, with whom they both kissed. The incident was highly publicized.[71] In 2008, MTV listed the performance as the number-one opening moment in the history of MTV Video Music Awards,[78] while Blender magazine cited it as one of the twenty-five sexiest music moments on television history.[79] Spears released her fourth studio album, In the Zone, in November 2003. She assumed more creative control by writing and co-producing most of the material.[24] Vibe called it \"A supremely confident dance record that also illustrates Spears's development as a songwriter.\"[80] NPR listed the album as one of \"The 50 Most Important Recording of the Decade\", adding that \"the decade's history of impeccably crafted pop is written on her body of work.\"[81] In the Zone sold over 609,000 copies in the United States during its first week of availability in the United States, debuting at the top of the charts, making Spears the first female artist in the SoundScan era to have her first four studio albums to debut at number one.[24] It also debuted at the top of the charts in France and the top ten in Belgium, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands.[82] In the Zone sold over 10 million copies worldwide.[83] The album produced four singles: \"Me Against the Music\", a collaboration with Madonna; \"Toxic\"\u2014which won Spears her first Grammy for Best Dance Recording; \"Everytime\", and \"Outrageous\".[24]\n\nIn January 2004, Spears married childhood friend Jason Allen Alexander at A Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas, Nevada. The marriage was annulled 55 hours later, following a petition to the court that stated that Spears \"lacked understanding of her actions\".[84]\n\nIn March 2004, she embarked on The Onyx Hotel Tour in support of In the Zone.[85] In June 2004, Spears fell and injured her left knee during the music video shoot for \"Outrageous\". Spears underwent arthroscopic surgery. She was forced to remain six weeks with a thigh brace, followed by eight to twelve weeks of rehabilitation, which caused The Onyx Hotel Tour to be canceled.[86]\n\nDuring 2004, Spears became involved in the Kabbalah Centre through her friendship with Madonna.[87]\n\nIn July 2004, Spears became engaged to American dancer Kevin Federline, whom she had met three months before. The romance received intense attention from the media, since Federline had recently broken up with actress Shar Jackson, who was still pregnant with their second child at the time.[24] The stages of their relationship were chronicled in Spears's first reality show Britney & Kevin: Chaotic. They held a wedding ceremony on September 18, 2004, but were not legally married until three weeks later on October 6 due to a delay finalizing the couple's prenuptial agreement.[88] Shortly after, she released her first perfume with Elizabeth Arden, Curious, which broke the company's first-week gross for a perfume.[24] In October 2004, Spears took a career break to start a family.[89] Greatest Hits: My Prerogative, her first greatest hits compilation album, was released in November 2004.[90] Spears's cover version of Bobby Brown's \"My Prerogative\" was released as the lead single from the album, reaching the top of the charts in Finland, Ireland, Italy and Norway.[91] The second single, \"Do Somethin'\", was a top ten hit in Australia, the United Kingdom and other countries of mainland Europe.[92][93] In August 2005, Spears released \"Someday (I Will Understand)\", which was dedicated to her first child, a son, who was born the following month.[94] In November 2005, she released her first remix compilation, B in the Mix: The Remixes, which consists of eleven remixes.[95] It has sold over 1 million copies worldwide.[96]\n\n2006\u20132007: Personal struggles and Blackout\n\nSpears leaving court surrounded by press in October 2007\n\nIn February 2006, pictures surfaced of Spears driving with her son, Sean, on her lap instead of in a car seat. Child advocates were horrified by the photos of her holding the wheel with one hand and Sean with the other. Spears claimed that the situation happened because of a frightening encounter with paparazzi, and that it was a mistake on her part.[24] The following month, she guest-starred on the Will & Grace episode \"Buy, Buy Baby\" as closeted lesbian Amber Louise.[97] She announced she no longer studied Kabbalah in June 2006, explaining, \"my baby is my religion.\"[87] Two months later, Spears posed nude for the cover of Harper's Bazaar. The picture was heavily compared to Demi Moore's August 1991 Vanity Fair cover.[24] In September 2006, she gave birth to her second child, a son.[98] In November 2006, Spears filed for divorce from Federline, citing irreconcilable differences.[99] Their divorce was finalized in July 2007, when the couple reached a global settlement and agreed to share joint custody of their children.[100]\n\nSpears's aunt Sandra Bridges Covington, with whom she had been very close, died of ovarian cancer in January 2007.[101] In February, Spears stayed in a drug rehabilitation facility in Antigua for less than a day. The following night, she shaved her head with electric clippers at a hair salon in Tarzana, Los Angeles. She admitted herself to other treatment facilities during the following weeks.[102] In May 2007, she produced a series of promotional concerts at House of Blues venues, titled The M+M's Tour.[103] In October 2007, Spears lost physical custody of her children to Federline. The reasons of the court ruling were not revealed to the public.[104] Spears was also sued by Louis Vuitton over her 2005 music video \"Do Somethin'\" for upholstering her Hummer interior in counterfeit Louis Vuitton cherry blossom fabric, which resulted in the video being banned on European TV stations.[105]\n\nIn October 2007, Spears released her fifth studio album, Blackout. The album debuted at the top of charts in Canada and Ireland, number two in the U.S. Billboard 200, France, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom and the top ten in Australia, Korea, New Zealand and many European nations. In the United States, Spears became the only female artist to have her first five studio albums debut at the two top slots of the chart.[106] The album received positive reviews from critics and has sold over 3 million copies worldwide.[107][108] Blackout won Album of the Year at MTV Europe Music Awards 2008 and was listed as the fifth Best Pop Album of the Decade by The Times.[109][110] Spears performed the lead single \"Gimme More\" at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards. The performance was panned by many critics.[111] Despite the backlash, the single rocketed to worldwide success, peaking at number one in Canada and the top ten in almost every country it charted.[112][113] The second single \"Piece of Me\" reached the top of the charts in Ireland and reached the top five in Australia, Canada, Denmark, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The third single \"Break the Ice\" was released the following year and had moderate success due to Spears not being able to promote it properly.[114][115][116] In December 2007, Spears began a relationship with paparazzo Adnan Ghalib.[117]\n\n2008\u20132010: Conservatorship and Circus\n\nIn January 2008, Spears refused to relinquish custody of her sons to Federline's representatives. She was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after police that had arrived at her house noted she appeared to be under the influence of an unidentified substance. The following day, Spears's visitation rights were suspended at an emergency court hearing, and Federline was given sole physical and legal custody of the children. She was committed to the psychiatric ward of Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and put on 5150 involuntary psychiatric hold. The court placed her under temporary, and later, permanent[118] conservatorship of her father James Spears and attorney Andrew Wallet, giving them complete control of her assets.[24] She was released five days later.[119]\n\nThe following month, Spears guest-starred on the How I Met Your Mother episode \"Ten Sessions\" as receptionist Abby. She received positive reviews for her performance, as well as bringing the series its highest ratings ever.[120][121] In July 2008, Spears regained some visitation rights after coming to an agreement with Federline and his counsel.[122] In September 2008, Spears opened the MTV Video Music Awards with a pre-taped comedy sketch with Jonah Hill and an introduction speech. She won Best Female Video, Best Pop Video and Video of the Year for \"Piece of Me\".[123] A 60-minute introspective documentary, Britney: For the Record, was produced to chronicle Spears's return to the recording industry. Directed by Phil Griffin, For the Record was shot in Beverly Hills, Hollywood, and New York City during the third quarter of 2008.[124] The documentary was broadcast on MTV to 5.6 million viewers for the two airings on the premiere night. It was the highest rating in its Sunday night timeslot and in the network's history.[125]\n\nIn December 2008, Spears's sixth studio album Circus was released. It received positive reviews from critics[126] and debuted at number one in Canada, Czech Republic and the United States, and inside the top ten in many European nations.[113][127] In the United States, Spears became the youngest female artist to have five albums debut at number one, earning a place in Guinness World Records.[128] She also became the only act in the Soundscan era to have four albums debut with 500,000 or more copies sold.[127] The album was one of the fastest-selling albums of the year,[129] and has sold 4 million copies worldwide.[130] Its lead single, \"Womanizer\", became Spears's first number one in the Billboard Hot 100 since \"...Baby One More Time\". The single also topped the charts in Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Norway and Sweden.[131][132] It was also nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best Dance Recording.[133] In January 2009, Spears and her father James obtained a restraining order against her former manager Sam Lutfi, ex-boyfriend Adnan Ghalib and attorney Jon Eardley \u2013 all of whom, court documents claim, had been conspiring to gain control of Spears's affairs. The restraining order forbids Lutfi and Ghalib from contacting Spears or coming within 250 yards of her, her property or family members.[134] Spears embarked on The Circus Starring Britney Spears in March 2009. With a gross of U.S. $131.8 million, it became the fifth highest-grossing tour of the year.[135]\n\nIn November 2009, Spears released her second greatest hits album, The Singles Collection. The album's lead and only single, \"3\" became her third number one single in the U.S.[136] In May 2010, Spears's representatives confirmed she was dating her agent Jason Trawick, and that they had decided to end their professional relationship to focus on their personal relationship.[137] Spears designed a limited edition clothing line for Candie's, which was released in stores in July 2010.[138] In September 2010, she made a cameo appearance on a Spears-themed tribute episode of American TV show Glee, titled \"Britney/Brittany\". The episode drew Glee's highest ratings ever.[139][140]\n\n2011\u20132012: Femme Fatale and The X Factor\n\nIn March 2011, Spears released her seventh studio album Femme Fatale.[141] The album peaked at number one in the United States, Canada, and Australia, and peaked within the top ten on nearly every other chart. Its peak in the United States ties Britney with Mariah Carey and Janet Jackson for the third-most number ones among women.[3] It has sold 1 million copies in the United States, and has been certified platinum by the RIAA.[142]\n\nThe album's lead single, \"Hold It Against Me\" debuted at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Spears's fourth number-one single on the chart and making her the second artist in history to have two consecutive singles debut at number one, after Mariah Carey.[143] The second single \"Till the World Ends\" peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 in May,[144] while the third single \"I Wanna Go\" reached number seven in August. Femme Fatale became Spears's first album in which three of its songs reached the top ten of the chart. The fourth and final single \"Criminal\" was released in September 2011. The music video caused controversy when British politicians criticized Spears for using replica guns while filming the video in an area of London that had been badly affected by the 2011 England riots.[145] Spears's management briefly responded, stating, \"The video is a fantasy story featuring Britney's boyfriend, Jason Trawick, which literally plays out the lyrics of a song written three years before the riots ever happened.\"[146] In April 2011, Spears appeared in a remix of Rihanna's song \"S&M\".[147] It reached number one in the US later in the month, giving Spears her fifth number one on the chart.[148] On Billboard's 2011 Year-End list, Spears was ranked number fourteen on the Artists of the Year,[149] thirty-two on Billboard 200 artists and ten on Billboard Hot 100 artists.[150][151] Spears co-wrote \"Whiplash\", a song from American pop rock band Selena Gomez & the Scene' third album When the Sun Goes Down.[152]\n\nIn June 2011, Spears embarked on the Femme Fatale Tour.[153] The first ten dates of the tour grossed $6.2 million, landing the fifty-fifth spot on Pollstar's Top 100 North American Tours list for the half-way point of the year.[154] The tour ended on December 10, 2011 in Puerto Rico after 79 performances.[155] A DVD of the tour was released in November 2011.[156] In August 2011, Spears received the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards.[157] The next month, she released her second remix album, B in the Mix: The Remixes Vol. 2.[158] In December, Spears became engaged to her long-time boyfriend Jason Trawick, who had formerly been her agent.[159] Trawick became a co-conservator of Spears, alongside her father, in April 2012.[160] In January 2013, Spears and Trawick ended their engagement. Trawick was also removed as Spears's co-conservator, restoring her father as the sole conservator.[161][162]\n\nIn May 2012, Spears was hired to replace Nicole Scherzinger as a judge for the second season of the U.S. version of The X Factor, joining Simon Cowell, L.A. Reid and fellow new judge Demi Lovato, who replaced Paula Abdul. With a reported salary of $15 million, she became the highest-paid judge on a singing competition series in television history.[163] However, Katy Perry broke her record in 2018 after Perry was signed for a $25-million salary to serve as a judge on ABC's revival of American Idol.[164][165] Spears mentored the Teens category; her final act, Carly Rose Sonenclar, was named the runner-up of the season.

Her team also announced that Spears would go on an indefinite work hiatus, putting all activities and commitments on hold, so that she can spend time with her family.[239] In March 2019, Spears's co-conservator Andrew Wallet resigned, and said \"Substantial detriment, irreparable harm and immediate danger will result to the conservatee and her estate if the relief requested herein in not granted on an ex parte basis.\"[240] The same month, Spears reportedly entered a psychiatric facility to focus on self-care amidst stress from her father's illness.[241] The podcast Britney's Gram alleged, according to information from an anonymous paralegal source, that Spears had been held against her will in the facility since January 2019. They claimed the hospitalization and Domination cancellation were ordered by Spears's father after she decided to not take her medication and violated rules in her conservatorship, specifically driving. Britney's Gram and several news outlets questioned the length of the conservatorship, as it was supposed to end after The Circus Tour in 2009.[242] This gave birth to the #FreeBritney movement, which saw support from a number of celebrities, such as Cher, Paris Hilton, Mario Lopez, Miley Cyrus, Courtney Love, Rose McGowan, Heidi Montag, Jeffree Star, Eve, and Tinashe.[243][244][245][246][247][248][249][250][251]\n\nFollowing the podcast, there was social media backlash to the alleged abuse of power and violation of human rights Spears has endured under a conservatorship by her father and the mismanagement of Lou Taylor, who was responsible for initiating the conservatorship.[252] TMZ later posted several conflicting stories, detailing in a video that although Spears had not been formally diagnosed with bipolar disorder, she is receiving medication for it, and justified this, which was later deleted.[253] On April 22, 2019, fans held a protest outside the West Hollywood City Hall, drawing attention towards the prolonged conservatorship, suggesting she was being detained against her will.[254][255][256] Spears posted a video Instagram account on April 24, assuring fans all is well and also addressed leaked emails about Lou Taylor, claiming they were written by her ex-manager Sam Lutfi.[257][258] Spears left the facility the following day.[259] It was reported on April 24, 2019, that Spears would have a new conservatorship hearing for May 10, 2019.[260] Spears attended the hearing with her mother.[261][262] Following the hearing, an investigation was ordered into Spears's conservatorship.[263]\n\nOn September 3, 2019, it was reported that Spears's father and conservator allegedly abused her 13-year-old son, Sean Preston. Law enforcement spoke to The Blast to report the incident, stating Kevin Federline filed a police report on August 25.[264] It was later reported that Jamie Spears was reportedly so enraged during a verbal row with his 13-year-old grandson that he broke down a door to get to the young boy, and the incident has sparked a child abuse investigation. Britney then sent her sons back to their father's home, despite it still being her custodial visit time.[265] Spears's two sons have since been granted a three year restraining order against their grandfather.[266] On May 29, 2020, Spears released Glory's Japanese-exclusive bonus track, \"Mood Ring\", to streaming and digital platforms worldwide.[267]\n\nArtistry\n\nInfluences\n\nleft) and right) as her major musical influences Spears credits artists such as Madonna ) and Janet Jackson ) as her major musical influences\n\nSpears has cited Madonna, Janet Jackson, and Whitney Houston as being major influences in her career, her \"three favorite artists\" as a child, whom she would \"sing along to [...] day and night in [her] living room\"; Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" was the song she auditioned to that landed her record deal with Jive Records.[268] Throughout her career, Spears has drawn frequent comparisons to Madonna and Jackson in particular, in terms of vocals, choreography and stage presence. According to Spears: \"I know when I was younger, I looked up to people... like, you know, Janet Jackson and Madonna. And they were major inspirations for me. But I also had my own identity and I knew who I was.\"[269] In the 2002 book Madonnastyle by Carol Clerk, she is quoted saying: \"I have been a huge fan of Madonna since I was a little girl. She's the person that I've really looked up to. I would really, really like to be a legend like Madonna.\"[270]\n\nAfter meeting Spears face to face, Janet Jackson stated: \"she said to me, 'I'm such a big fan; I really admire you.' That's so flattering. Everyone gets inspiration from some place. And it's awesome to see someone else coming up who's dancing and singing, and seeing how all these kids relate to her. A lot of people put it down, but what she does is a positive thing.\"[271] Madonna said of Spears in the documentary Britney: For the Record: \"I admire her talent as an artist [...] There are aspects about her that I recognize in myself when I first started out in my career\".[272] She has also named Michael Jackson, Mariah Carey, Sheryl Crow, Otis Redding, Shania Twain, Brandy, Beyonc\u00e9, Natalie Imbruglia, Cher, and Prince as sources of inspiration.[273][274][275][276][277] Spears also felt inspired by artists of younger generations, such as Selena Gomez and Ariana Grande.[278][279]\n\nMusical style\n\nSpears is described as a pop singer[16] and generally explores the genre in the form of dance-pop.[282] Following her debut, she was credited with influencing the revival of teen pop in the late 1990s.[283] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone wrote: \"Spears carries on the classic archetype of the rock & roll teen queen, the dungaree doll, the angel baby who just has to make a scene.\"[284] In a review for ...Baby One More Time, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic referred to her music as a \"blend of infectious, rap-inflected dance-pop and smooth balladry.\"[285] Oops!...I Did It Again saw Spears working with several contemporary R&B producers, which led to \"a combination of bubblegum, urban soul, and raga.\"[286] Her third studio album, Britney derived from the teen pop niche \"[r]hythmically and melodically\", but was described as \"sharper, tougher than what came before\", incorporating genres such as R&B, disco and funk.[59][287]\n\nSpears has explored and heavily incorporated the genres of electropop[288][289] and dance music in her records, as well as influences of urban and hip hop which are most present in In the Zone and Blackout.[289][290][291] Femme Fatale and Britney Jean were also heavily influenced by electronic music genres.[292][293]\n\nThe music found on ...Baby One More Time and Oops!... I Did It Again generally explores themes such as love and relationships from a teenager's point of view.[294][295] After the enormous success of her first two studio albums, Spears's team and producers wanted to maintain the formula that took her to the top of the charts.[294] Spears, however, was no longer satisfied with the sound and themes covered on her records. She co-wrote five songs and choose each track's producer on Britney, her third studio album, which lyrics address the subjects of reaching adulthood, sexuality and self-discovery.[59][294][287] Sex, dancing, freedom and love continued to be Spears's music main subjects on her subsequent albums.[290][291][293][292] Her fifth studio album, Blackout, also address issues such as media scrutiny and fame, most notably in \"Piece of Me\".[291][296]\n\nVoice\n\nSpears is a soprano.[301][302][303][304] Prior to her breakthrough success, she is described as having sung \"much deeper than her highly recognizable trademark voice of today\", with Eric Foster White, who worked with Spears for her debut album ...Baby One More Time, being cited as \"[shaping] her voice over the course of a month\" upon being signed to Jive Records \"to where it is today\u2014distinctively, unmistakably Britney\".[28] Rami Yacoub who co-produced Spears's debut album with lyricist Max Martin, commented, \"I know from Denniz Pop and Max's previous productions, when we do songs, there's kind of a nasal thing. With N' Sync and the Backstreet Boys, we had to push for that mid-nasal voice. When Britney did that, she got this kind of raspy, sexy voice.\"[305]\n\nGuy Blackman of The Age wrote that \"[t]he thing about Spears, though, is that her biggest songs, no matter how committee-created or impossibly polished, have always been convincing because of her delivery, her commitment and her presence. [...] Spears expresses perfectly the conflicting urges of adolescence, the tension between chastity and sexual experience, between hedonism and responsibility, between confidence and vulnerability.\"[306] Producer William Orbit, who collaborated with Spears on her album Britney Jean, stated regarding her vocals: \"[Britney] didn't get so big just because [she] put on great shows; [she] got to be that way because [her voice is] unique: you hear two words and you know who is singing\".[307]\n\nSpears has also been criticized for her reliance on Auto-Tune[308] and her vocals being \"over-processed\" on records.[309] Erlewine criticized Spears's singing abilities in a review for Blackout, saying, \"Never the greatest vocalist, her thin squawk could be dismissed early in her career as an adolescent learning the ropes, but nearly a decade later her singing hasn't gotten any better, even if the studio tools to masquerade her weaknesses have.\"[291] Joan Anderman of The Boston Globe remarked that \"Spears sounds robotic, nearly inhuman, on her records, so processed is her voice by digital pitch-shifters and synthesizers.\"[310] The Michigan Daily's Kayla Upadhyaya provided a different point of view, saying, \"Auto-tuned and over-processed vocals define Britney's voice as an artist, and in her music, auto-tune isn't so much a gimmick as it is an instrument used to highlight, contort and make a statement.\"[311] Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly opined that \"Spears is no technical singer, that's for sure. But backed by Martin and Dr. Luke's wall of pound, her vocals melt into a mix of babytalk coo and coital panting that is, in its own overprocessed way, just as iconic and propulsive as Michael Jackson's yips or Eminem's snarls.\"[312]\n\nStage performances\n\nSpears is known for her stage performances, particularly the elaborate dance routines which incorporate \"belly-dancing and tempered erotic moves\" that are credited for influencing \"dance-heavy acts\" such as Danity Kane and the Pussycat Dolls.[313][314] Rolling Stone magazine readers voted Spears as the second Favorite Dancing Musician.[315] Spears is described as being much more shy than what her stage persona suggests.[316][317][318] She claimed that performing is \"a boost to [her] confidence. It's like an alter-ego type thing. Something clicks and I go and turn into this different person. I think it's kind of a gift to be able to do that.\"[319] Her 2000, 2001, and 2003 MTV Video Music Awards performances received praise,[320] while her 2007 presentation was widely panned by critics, as she \"teetered through her dance steps and mouthed only occasional words\".[321] Billboard called her 2016 \"comeback\" performance at the show \"An effective, but not entirely glorious, bid to regain pop superstardom\".[303]\n\nAfter her knee injuries and personal struggles, Spears's \"showmanship\" and dance abilities came under criticism.[313][322] Serge F. Kovaleski of The New York Times watched her Las Vegas concert residency in 2016 and said: \"Once a fluid, natural dancer, Ms. Spears can appear stiff, even robotic, today, relying on flailing arms and flashy sets.\"[323] Las Vegas Sun's Robin Leach seemed more impressed over Spears's efforts on the concert by saying that she delivered a \"flawless performance\" on the residency's opening night.[324]\n\nIt has been widely reported that Spears lip-syncs during live performances,[314][325][326] which often draws criticism from music critics and concert goers.[322][327][328] Some, however, claimed that, although she \"got plenty of digital support\", she \"doesn't merely lip-sync\" during her live shows.[329] In 2016, Sabrina Weiss of Refinery29 referred to her lip-syncing as a \"well-known fact that's not even taboo anymore.\"[330] Noting on the prevalence of lip-syncing, Los Angeles Daily News opined: \"In the context of a Britney Spears concert, does it really matter? [...] you [just] go for the somewhat-ridiculous spectacle of it all\".[331] Spears spoke on the topic saying \"[...] Because I'm dancing so much, I do have a little bit of playback, but there's a mixture of my voice and the playback.\" She added: \"It really pisses me off because I'm busting my ass out there and singing at the same time and nobody ever gives me credit for it, you know?\"[325]\n\nPublic image\n\nUpon launching her music career with ...Baby One More Time, Spears was labeled a teen idol,[332] and Rolling Stone described her as \"the latest model of a classic product: the unneurotic pop star who performs her duties with vaudevillian pluck and spokesmodel charm.\"[23] The April 1999 cover of Rolling Stone featured Spears lying on her bed, wearing an open top revealing her bra, and shorts, while clutching a Teletubby.[23][333] The American Family Association (AFA) referred to the shoot as \"a disturbing mix of childhood innocence and adult sexuality\" and called on \"God-loving Americans to boycott stores selling Britney's albums.\" Spears responded to the outcry commenting, \"What's the big deal? I have strong morals. [...] I'd do it again. I thought the pictures were fine. And I was tired of being compared to Debbie Gibson and all of this bubblegum pop all the time.\"[334] Shortly before, Spears had announced publicly she would remain a virgin until marriage.[24][335]\n\nWax figure of Spears at Madame Tussauds in London\n\nBillboard opined that, by the time she released her second album Oops!... I Did it Again, \"There was a shift occurring in both the music and her public image: She was sharper, sexier and singing about more grown-up fare, setting the stage for 2001\u2019s Britney, which shed her innocent skin and ushered her into adulthood.\"[336] Britney's lead single \"I'm a Slave 4 U\" and its video were also credited for distancing her from her \"wholesome bubblegum star\" image of the past.[337][338] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commented, \"If 2001's Britney was a transitional album, capturing Spears at the point when she wasn't a girl and not yet a woman, its 2003 follow-up, In the Zone, is where she has finally completed that journey and turned into Britney, the Adult Woman.\" Erlewine compared Spears to her peer Christina Aguilera, explaining that both equated \"maturity with transparent sexuality and the pounding sounds of nightclubs\".[290] Brittany Spanos of LA Weekly said that Spears \"set the bar for the \"adulthood\" transition teen pop stars often struggle with\".[339]\n\nSpears's erratic behavior and personal struggles during 2006\u20142008 were highly publicized[340] and affected both her career and public image.[291][341] Erlewine reflected on that time of her life by saying that \"each new disaster [was] stripping away any residual sexiness in her public image\".[291] In a 2008 article, Rolling Stone's Vanessa Grigoriadis described her much-publicized personal issues as \"the most public downfall of any star in history\".[341] Spears later received favorable media attention. Billboard claimed that her appearance at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards \"was a picture of professionalism and poise\" after her \"disastrous\" 2007 performance at the show,[342] while Business Insider published an article about how Spears \"lost control of her life [...] and then made an incredible career comeback\".[343] Spears later reflected on that tumultuous time of her life and career: \"I think I had to give myself more breaks through my career and take responsibility for my mental health. [...] I wrote back then, that I was lost and didn't know what to do with myself. I was trying to please everyone around me because that\u2019s who I am deep inside. There are moments where I look back and think: 'What the hell was I thinking?'\"[344]\n\nIn September 2002, she was ranked eight on VH1's 100 Sexiest Artists list,[345] and, in December 2012, Complex ranked her 12 on its 100 Hottest Female Singers of All Time list.[346] Spears commented on her sex symbol image by saying, \"[...] When I'm on stage, that's my time to do my thing and go there and be that \u2014 and it's fun. It's exhilarating just to be something that you're not. And people tend to believe it.\"[294] In 2003, People cited her as one of the 50 Most Beautiful People.[347]\n\nSpears is recognized as a gay icon and was honored with the 2018 GLAAD Vanguard Award at the GLAAD Media Awards for her role in \"accelerating acceptance for the LGBTQ community\".[232] Spears addressed the \"unwavering loyalty\" and \"lack of judgement\" of her LGBTQ fans in Billboard's Love Letters to the LGBTQ Community. She said: \"Your stories are what inspire me, bring me joy, and make me and my sons strive to be better people.\"[348] Manuel Betancourt of Vice magazine wrote about the \"queer adoration\", especially of gay men, on Spears, and said that \"Where other gay icons exude self-possession, Spears's fragile resilience has made her an even more fascinating role model, closer to Judy Garland than to Lady Gaga [...] she's a glittering mirror ball, a fractured reflection of those men on the dance floor back onto themselves.\"[316] HuffPost's Ben Appel attributed Spears's status as a gay icon to \"her oh-so-innocent/\"not that innocent\" Monroe-like sensuality, her sweet, almost saccharine nature, her beyond basic but addictive pop songs, her dance moves, her phoenix-out-of-the-fire comeback from a series of mental health crises, and her unmistakable tenderness. Britney is camp. She is a fashion plate. A doll. Britney is a drag queen.\"[349]\n\nSince her early years of stardom, Spears become a tabloid fixture and a paparazzi target.[336][335][350] Steve Huey of AllMusic claimed that \"among female singers of [Spears's] era [...] her celebrity star power was rivaled only by Jennifer Lopez.\"[335] 'Britney Spears' was Yahoo!'s most popular search term between 2005 and 2008, and has been in a total of seven different years.[351] Spears was named as Most Searched Person in the Guinness World Records book edition 2007 and 2009.[352] She was later named as the most searched person of the decade 2000\u20132009.[353]\n\nAs a public figure, Spears \"has never been very publicly political\".[354] In October 2001, she registered as a Republican in Louisiana, according to public records.[354] In a September 2003 interview on CNN, she spoke about the then-U.S. President George W. Bush and the Iraq War, by saying that \"we should just trust our president in every decision that he makes [...] and be faithful in what happens\".[354][355] In 2016, she posted photos of a meeting with Hillary Clinton on her social media.[354] In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Spears posted an image on her Instagram account stating \"During this time of isolation ... We will feed each other, redistribute wealth, strike. We will understand our own importance from the places we must stay,\" along with three emoji roses, \"a symbol commonly used by the Democratic Socialists of America\".[356]\n\nLegacy\n\nReferred to as the \"Princess of Pop\",[39][357] Spears was credited as one of the \"driving force[s] behind the return of teen pop in the late 1990s\".[335][283] Rolling Stone explained that she \"help[ed] to usher in a new era for the genre that had gone dormant in the decade that followed New Kids on the Block. [...] Spears would lead an army of pop stars... built on slick Max Martin productions, plenty of sexual innuendo and dance-heavy performances. [She became] one of the most successful artists of all time \u2014 and a cautionary tale for a generation, whether they paid attention or not.\"[357] Billboard's Robert Kelly observed that Spears's \"sexy and coy\" vocals on her debut single \"...Baby One More Time\" \"kicked off a new era of pop vocal stylings that would influence countless artists to come.\"[358]\n\nAfter eighteen years as a performer, Billboard claimed that she \"has earned her title as one of pop's reigning queens. Since her early days as a Mouseketeer, [Spears] has pushed the boundaries of 21st century sounds, paving the way for a generation of artists to shamelessly embrace glossy pop and redefine how one can accrue consistent success in the music industry.\"[336] Entertainment Weekly's Adam Markovitz described Spears as \"an American institution, as deeply sacred and messed up as pro wrestling or the filibuster.\"[312] In 2012, she was ranked as the fourth VH1's 50 Greatest Women of the Video Era show list.[359] VH1 also cited her among its choices on the 100 Greatest Women in Music in 2012[360] and the 200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons in 2003.[361]\n\nSpears's work has influenced numerous artists including Katy Perry,[362] Meghan Trainor,[363] Demi Lovato,[362] Kelly Key,[364] Kristinia DeBarge,[365] Little Boots,[366] Charli XCX,[367] Marina Diamandis,[368] Tegan and Sara,[369] Pixie Lott,[370] Grimes,[371] Selena Gomez,[372] Hailee Steinfeld,[373] Tinashe,[374] Victoria Justice,[375] Cassie,[376] Leah Wellbaum of Slothrust,[377] The Saturdays,[378] Normani,[379] Miley Cyrus,[380] Cheryl,[381] Lana Del Rey,[382] Ava Max,[383] and Billie Eilish.[384] During the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Lady Gaga said that Spears \"taught us all how to be fearless, and the industry wouldn't be the same without her.\"[385] Gaga has also cited Spears as an influence, calling her \"the most provocative performer of my time.\"[386] Before Spears joined The X Factor, Simon Cowell explained that he is \"fascinated by [Britney]. The fact that she's one of the most talked about \u2013 not just pop stars \u2013 but people in the world today, means that you've got this star power. [...] She's still hot, she's still having hit records and she's still controversial, there's a reason for that.\"[387] Marina Diamandis named Spears as the main influence behind her album Electra Heart.[388] Lana Del Rey has said that the music video for \"Toxic\" inspires her.[389] Spears has had a direct influence on singer Porcelain Black's work after growing up around her music as a child. Black describes her music as a \"love child between\" Marilyn Manson and Spears.[390]\n\nSpears's much-publicized personal struggles and her career comeback after this period has inspired some artists. Gwyneth Paltrow's character in the 2010 film Country Strong was inspired by the singer's treatment by the media. According to film director Shana Fest, \"that's where this movie came from. I mean, I was seeing what was happening in the media to Britney Spears. I think it's tragic how we treat people who give us so much, and we love to see them knocked down to build them back up again, to knock them down again.\"[391] Nicki Minaj has cited Spears's comeback after her much-publicized personal issues as an inspiration.[392] Spears's hounding by paparazzi and personal struggles also contributed to inspiring Barry Manilow's album 15 Minutes. Manilow said: \"She couldn't have a life without them pulling up next to her car and following her and driving her crazy to the point where, that was around the time she shaved off her hair. [...] We all looked at it in horror [...] So it seemed like a thing to be writing an album about.\"[393] Bebo Norman wrote a song about Spears, called \"Britney\", which was inspired by \"culture's make-or-break treatment of celebrities.\"[394]\n\nAwards and achievements\n\nThroughout her career, Spears has earned numerous awards and accolades, including a Grammy Award; thirteen Guinness World Records; six MTV Video Music Awards, including the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award; seven Billboard Music Awards, including the Millennium Award; the inaugural Radio Disney Icon Award; the GLAAD Media Award's Vanguard Award and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nShe is listed by the Guinness World Records as having the \"Best-selling album by a teenage solo artist\" for her debut album ...Baby One More Time which sold over thirteen million copies in the United States.[395] Melissa Ruggieri of the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported: \"She's also marked for being the best-selling teenage artist. Before she turned 20 in 2001, Spears had sold over 37 million albums worldwide\".[396]\n\nAs of 2017 , according to the BBC, she has sold 100 million records worldwide,[397] making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time; and more than 70 million records in United States, including 36.9 million digital singles and 33.6 million digital albums.[7][8] Spears is also recognized as the best-selling female albums artist of the 2000s in the United States, as well as the fifth overall.[10] In December 2009, Billboard ranked Spears the 8th Artist of the 2000s decade in the United States.[6] She is one of the few artists in history to have had a number-one single and a number-one studio album in the US during each of the three decades of her career.[398] With \"3\" in 2009 and \"Hold It Against Me\" in 2011, she became the second artist after Mariah Carey in the Hot 100's history to debut at number one with two or more songs.[143] In 2016, Spears ranked at number twenty on Billboard's Greatest Of All Time Top Dance Club Artists list.[399]\n\nOther ventures\n\nProduct and endorsements\n\nIn 2000, Spears released a limited edition of sunglasses titled Shades of Britney.[400] In 2001, she signed a deal with shoe company Skechers,[401] and a $7\u20138 million promotional deal with Pepsi, their biggest entertainment deal at the time.[402] Aside from numerous commercials with the latter during that year, she also appeared in a 2004 Pepsi television commercial in the theme of \"Gladiators\" with singers Beyonc\u00e9, Pink, and Enrique Iglesias.[403] On June 19, 2002, she released her first multi-platform video game, Britney's Dance Beat, which received positive reviews.[404] In March 2009, Spears was announced as the new face of clothing brand Candie's.[405] Dari Marder, chief marketing officer for the brand, explained why they choose the singer, saying, \"everybody loves a comeback and nobody's doing it better than Britney. She's just poised for even greater success.\"[405] In 2010, Spears designed a limited edition line for the brand, which was released in stores in July 2010.[138] In 2011, she teamed up with Sony, Make Up For Ever and PlentyofFish to release her music video for \"Hold It Against Me\", earning her $500,000 for the product placement.[406] Spears also teamed up with Hasbro in 2012 to release an exclusive version of Twister Dance, which includes a remix of \"Till the World Ends\". The singer was also featured on a commercial, which was directed by Ray Kay, to promote the game. Spears was also featured on the commercial of \"Twister Rave\" and the game included a Twister remix of \"Circus\".[407] In March 2018, it was revealed that Spears would be the face of Kenzo, a contemporary French luxury clothing house.[230]\n\nSpears's range of commercial deals and products also includes beauty care products and perfumes. She released her first perfume with Elizabeth Arden, Curious in 2004, which broke the company's first-week gross for a perfume.[24] By 2009, she had released seven more perfumes including Fantasy.[408][409] In 2010, Spears released her eighth fragrance, Radiance. In March 2011, company Brand Sense filed a lawsuit against Spears and Elizabeth Arden seeking $10 million in damages, claiming that the singer and her father, Jamie, stopped paying their thirty-five percent commission that was agreed as part of the contract terms.[410] In July 2011, a Los Angeles judge denied the request by the company lawyers, claiming the fact that Spears is still under conservatorship.[411] Brand Sense, however, stated that they would appeal the decision.[411] In 2011, Radiance was re-issued as a new perfume titled Cosmic Radiance.[412] Worldwide, Spears sold over one million bottles in the first five years, with gross receipts of $1.5 billion. In 2016, Spears contacted Glu Mobile to create her own role-playing game, Britney Spears: American Dream. The app officially launched in May 2016 and is compatible with IOS and Android.[203] On June 17, 2016, Spears announced the release of her twentieth fragrance, Private Show.[413] As of January 2018 , Spears has released 24 fragrances through Elizabeth Arden.[414]\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nSpears founded The Britney Spears Foundation, a charitable entity set up to help children in need. The philosophy behind the Foundation was that music and entertainment has a healing quality that can benefit children.[415] The Foundation also supported the annual Britney Spears Camp for the Performing Arts, where campers had the opportunity to explore and develop their talents.[416] In April 2002, through the efforts of Spears and The Britney Spears Foundation, a grant of $1 million was made to the Twin Towers Fund to support the children of uniformed service heroes affected by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, including New York City Fire Department and its Emergency Medical Services Command, the New York City Police Department, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the New York State Office of court Administration and other government offices.[417] However, it was reported in 2008 that the Foundation had a deficit of $200,000.[418] After the singer went through conservatorship, her father and lawyer Andrew Wallet zeroed out the effort, leading to its closure in 2011.[419]\n\nOn October 30, 2001, Spears, alongside Bono and other popular recording artists under the name \"Artists Against AIDS Worldwide\", released a single titled \"What's Going On\", with the intention to benefit AIDS programs in Africa and other impoverished regions.[420] In the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2006, Spears donated $350,000 to Music Rising.[421] Later in 2011, the singer raised $200,000 during An Evening of Southern Style at a private residence in Beverly Hills to benefit the St. Bernard Project, with the help of several celebrities, including Hilary Duff, Selena Gomez, Kelly Osbourne, Kellan Lutz and Kim Kardashian.[422] Spears has also helped several charities during her career, including Madonna's Kabbalah-based Spirituality for Kids,[423] cancer charity Gilda's Club Worldwide,[424] Promises Foundation, and United Way, with the latter two focused on giving families from various disadvantaged situations new hope and stable foundations for the future.[421]\n\nOn October 24, 2015, Spears donated $120,000 to the Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation.[425] In addition, $1 of each ticket sale for her Las Vegas residency, Britney: Piece of Me, was donated to the nonprofit organization.[426] Spears also fundraised for the charity through social media, in addition to selling limited edition merchandise, with all proceeds going to the NCCF.[427] On October 27, 2016, Spears partnered with Zappos and XCYCLE to host the Britney Spears Piece of Me Charity Ride in Boca Park, Las Vegas to raise additional money toward her goal of $1 million for the NCCF, with $450,000 having already been raised from Spears's ticket sales and merchandise.[428] Participants were entered for a chance to win a spin class with Spears herself. The event ultimately went on to raise $553,130.[429] The fundraising ultimately led to the development of the NCCF Britney Spears Campus in Las Vegas, which saw its grand opening on November 4, 2017.[430] Spears also regularly participates in Spirit Day to combat bullying of LGBTQ youth and bullying.[431]\n\nDiscography\n\nFilmography\n\nConcerts\n\nTours\n\nResidencies\n\nBritney: Piece of Me (2013\u20132017)\n\nBritney: Domination (TBD; Placed on hold due to hiatus)\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nCitations", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Britney_Spears_2013_%28Straighten_Crop%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Britney_Spears_2013_%28Straighten_Crop%29.jpg/200px-Britney_Spears_2013_%28Straighten_Crop%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Britney_Spears_-_Madame_Tussauds_London.jpg/180px-Britney_Spears_-_Madame_Tussauds_London.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Britney_Spears_Hollywood_Star.jpg/220px-Britney_Spears_Hollywood_Star.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/wikimedia-button.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Britney-Spears_Boys.jpg/180px-Britney-Spears_Boys.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/32px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Britney_Spears.jpg/170px-Britney_Spears.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Audio-input-microphone.png/28px-Audio-input-microphone.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/JanetJacksonUnbreakableTourSanFran2015_%28cropped%29.jpg/133px-JanetJacksonUnbreakableTourSanFran2015_%28cropped%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/10px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Madonna_Rebel_Heart_Tour_2015_-_Stockholm_%2823051472299%29_%28cropped_2%29.jpg/133px-Madonna_Rebel_Heart_Tour_2015_-_Stockholm_%2823051472299%29_%28cropped_2%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1b/Semi-protection-shackle.svg/20px-Semi-protection-shackle.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/FFT4.jpg/220px-FFT4.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/BritneyPOM3.jpg/180px-BritneyPOM3.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg/50px-Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/69/P_vip.svg/28px-P_vip.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Britney_Spears%2C_Roundhouse%2C_London_%28Apple_Music_Festival_2016%29_%2830072929931%29_%28cropped%29.jpg/170px-Britney_Spears%2C_Roundhouse%2C_London_%28Apple_Music_Festival_2016%29_%2830072929931%29_%28cropped%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Britney_Spears_car_october_2007_%28cropped%29.jpg/220px-Britney_Spears_car_october_2007_%28cropped%29.jpg"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Britney_Spears_2013_%28Straighten_Crop%29.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "title": "Britney Spears", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.35.0-wmf.40", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "og": {"image": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Britney_Spears_2013_%28Straighten_Crop%29.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}

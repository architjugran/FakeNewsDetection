Our businesses are open 24/7 and, of course, we're always working and grinding. But then I started talking to her and then realised, very quickly, just how wrong I was.\"\n\nOhanian co-founded the news website Reddit in 2005 and became a multi-millionaire aged 23 when he sold it 16 months later. He met Williams at a cafe in Italy in 2015 and improved the tennis ace's website with a superior \"tech strategy\" while also helping secure \"deal flows with sponsorships and investments.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pair got married in 2017 and Ohanian said Williams has inspired him in business.\"It's a front row seat to greatness and that is what I'm working towards in my own career,\" he said.\n\nOhanian and Williams had a daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr., in September last year. Since then, Williams has returned to tennis and almost captured her first major since being a mom, what would have been her 24th Grand Slam title, when she reached the 2018 Wimbledon Championships final - but she missed out to Angelique Kerber.\n\nOhanian co-founded Initialized Capital in 2010, is an Open Internet activist (an advocate for net neutrality), and is widely regarded as \"one of the most creative people in business.\"", "images": ["https://static-ssl.businessinsider.com/image/5b6053d6b354cd21008b48d7-2000/serena williams and alexis ohanian.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=9900186&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.businessinsider.com/photo/50740876/downarrow.jpg", "https://www.businessinsider.in/photo/65215774/serena-williams-inspires-her-reddit-co-founder-husbands-career-in-tech-and-he-says-his-marriage-is-a-front-row-seat-to-greatness.jpg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/thumb/msid-60085318,width-65,height-47/default-thumb.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=13194393&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.businessinsider.com/thumb/msid-60085318,width-100,height-70/default-thumb.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.businessinsider.in/photo/65215774/serena-williams-inspires-her-reddit-co-founder-husbands-career-in-tech-and-he-says-his-marriage-is-a-front-row-seat-to-greatness.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://www.businessinsider.com/alexis-ohanian-marriage-to-serena-williams-is-a-front-row-seat-to-greatness-2018-7", "title": "Serena Williams inspires her Reddit co-founder husband's career in tech - and he says his marriage is 'a front row seat to greatness'", "meta_data": {"description": "ReutersSerena Williams and Alexis Ohanian.Alexis Ohanian, the Reddit co-founder, always assumed he was the hardest-working person he knew.But he realised how", "keywords": "sportspage,SAI", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@BiIndia", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.in/serena-williams-inspires-her-reddit-co-founder-husbands-career-in-tech-and-he-says-his-marriage-is-a-front-row-seat-to-greatness/articleshow/65215774.cms", "title": "Serena Williams inspires her Reddit co-founder husband's career in tech - and he says his marriage is 'a front row seat to greatness'", "description": "ReutersSerena Williams and Alexis Ohanian.Alexis Ohanian, the Reddit co-founder, always assumed he was the hardest-working person he knew.But he realised how", "image": "https://www.businessinsider.in/photo/65215774/serena-williams-inspires-her-reddit-co-founder-husbands-career-in-tech-and-he-says-his-marriage-is-a-front-row-seat-to-greatness.jpg"}, "news_keywords": "sportspage,SAI", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "type": "article", "title": "Serena Williams inspires her Reddit co-founder husband's career in tech - and he says his marriage is 'a front row seat to greatness'", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.in/serena-williams-inspires-her-reddit-co-founder-husbands-career-in-tech-and-he-says-his-marriage-is-a-front-row-seat-to-greatness/articleshow/65215774.cms", "image": "https://www.businessinsider.in/photo/65215774/serena-williams-inspires-her-reddit-co-founder-husbands-career-in-tech-and-he-says-his-marriage-is-a-front-row-seat-to-greatness.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 645465345465774, "admins": 556964827}, "website": "https://www.businessinsider.in", "robots": "NOODP", "google-site-verification": "NpZv5Qfl0TuFiebbwMualP_h2a3QtmQGFjE9hhw9um8", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}

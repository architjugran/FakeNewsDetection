News spoke to her at the 2017 CMA Awards where she dished on her friend, Taylor.\n\nWhile Taylor was not at the event in Nashville on Wednesday night, Rose was still singing Swift\u2019s praises, mainly when it came to her sixth studio album, Reputation.\n\nThank you for having me Nashville!!! CMAS \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f #cmas A post shared by Ruby Rose (@rubyrose) on Nov 8, 2017 at 5:43pm PST\n\nIn fact, the star got to hear the tracks thanks to a special invitation to one of Swift\u2019s secret listening sessions.\n\n\u2018It was a secret,\u2019 she joked about the gathering. \u2018It was great. It was amazing. I\u2019m pumped for the album. It\u2019s fantastic, and I bet everyone else is excited as well.\u2019\n\nWhile Taylor may have shifted musical genres in the past few years since her country beginnings, and according to Rose, all of her music still shares her flair for storytelling.\n\nTwo unique magazines. Poetry, paintings, lyrics & polaroids. Available Friday. A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Nov 7, 2017 at 11:53am PST\n\n\u2018I love all of Taylor Swift\u2019s music,\u2019 Roby confessed.\n\n\u2018My favorite thing about the country is how they tell stories and that it feels so relatable, and it feels like you know that person, and I love how she\u2019s transformed that into pop music and now we\u2019re getting these sort of stories within a pop realm where there wasn\u2019t necessarily as clever storytelling before.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaylor\u2019s album is dropping on Friday, and we can\u2019t wait to listen to all of it! Her fans are anxious as well, we bet!", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/javicia-leslie-ruby-rose-new-batwoman-star-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/naya-rivera-headlineplanet-com-300x165.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/katy-perry-youtube-com_-700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/maxresdefault-1-3-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2060%2060%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2042%2042%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BrandonFitch-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/kelly-rowland-300x300.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Taylor-Swift-QZ.com--700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jay-z-nme-com_-300x191.jpeg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%2035%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017-CMA-Awards-Ruby-Rose-Dishes-On-Taylor-Swifts-Secret-Sessions.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/moore-brooklyn-300x158.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/courtney-stodden-has-no-time-for-f-boys-300x220.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%202048%201536%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/scott-baio-and-donald-trump-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/The-Shady-Past-Of-Teen-Mom-2-Star-Briana-DeJesus-Baby-Daddy-Devoin-Austin-Revealed-700x466.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%2027%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/kandi-burruss8217-new-8216speak-on-it8217-episode-is-out-and-addresses-another-issue-involving-todd-tucker8217s-daughter-kaela-82-300x216.jpg"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017-CMA-Awards-Ruby-Rose-Dishes-On-Taylor-Swifts-Secret-Sessions.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brandon Fitch", "Delores Perry", "Angie Williamson", "Angela Williamson"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/2017-cma-awards-ruby-rose-dishes-on-taylor-swifts-secret-sessions-83793/", "title": "2017 CMA Awards: Ruby Rose Dishes On Taylor Swift\u2019s Secret Sessions", "meta_data": {"author": "Brandon Fitch", "news_keywords": "cma awards, ruby rose, taylor swift", "keywords": "celebrity news, cma awards, ruby rose, taylor swift", "p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "theme-color": "#dedede", "description": "Ruby Rose is also a fan of Taylor Swift, and she is her friend as well.

The director [Stephen Herek] and all of us were close... we all very young, we all had each other\u2019s backs. It was a very safe, familial environment.\"\n\nBefore appearing in 1989 hit Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, Winter had his breakthrough role as a young actor in horror comedy The Lost Boys (1987), alongside Corey Feldman. Feldman has also spoken about his traumatic experiences as a child actor, and recently claimed to have been sexually abused while working on The Lost Boys.", "images":

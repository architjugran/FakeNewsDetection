She says she's \"very secure and confident\" in her life already.\n\nThe 63-year-old is among the wealthiest businesswomen in the country and is one of the world's most recognizable black women.\n\nThe interview with InStyle's Laura Brown came several weeks before Winfrey gave a widely hailed speech at the Golden Globes awards. She focused her remarks on racial and gender equality, spawning the #Oprah2020 Twitter hashtag that trended for days.\n\nInStyle's March cover features Winfrey and the headline: 'Hello, Madam President?'", "images": ["https://media.nbcboston.com/2019/09/Boston_On_Light@3x.png?fit=435%2C120", "https://media.nbcboston.com/2019/09/GettyImages-1211126960.jpg?resize=850%2C478", "https://media.nbcboston.com/2020/07/California-Schools-Closed-July-13.jpg?resize=850%2C478", "https://media.nbcboston.com/2019/09/NBC@3x-7-2.png?fit=1024%2C576", "https://media.nbcboston.com/2019/09/Boston_On_Dark@3x-2.png?fit=435%2C120", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035083&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://media.nbcboston.com/2019/09/NBC@3x-7-2.png?fit=1024%2C576", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mckenna Aiello"], "canonical_link": "http://www.eonline.com/news/908864/oprah-winfrey-confirms-she-will-not-run-for-president-i-don-t-have-the-dna-for-it", "title": "'I Don't Have the DNA for It': Oprah Winfrey Said She Will Not Run for President", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "NBC Boston", "type": "article", "description": "Time to put those Oprah 2020 pins on backorder.

The \u201cStarboy\u201d singer donated $100,000 to the Suubi Health Center, a maternity and children\u2019s medical facility located in Budondo, Uganda.\n\nAccording to E! News, The Weeknd was motivated to make a donation because of French Montana\u2019s work to raise awareness for the health canter through Global Citizen, a social action platform, and Mama Hope.\n\nThe Moroccan rapper has been spreading the word through his #Unforgettable Dance video which is touted as a \u201ccall to action to raise awareness for the needs of Suubi and the people of Uganda.\u201d\n\nIn March, Montana traveled to Uganda to shoot the \u201cUnforgettable\u201d music video. Once he landed in Uganda, Montana met with the founders of the Suubi Center, and spoke with community members about some of the challenge that they face (especially new mothers and babies).\n\nMontana was so inspired by the visit that he pledged the first $100,000 donation to help pay for ambulances, premature incubators, cribs and a blood bank for the Suubi community. He\u2019s now challenging others (including some of his musical peers like The Weeknd) to make donations to help pay for the new maternity center.\n\nClick here for more information on Montana\u2019s #Unforgettable Dance challenge.\n\nThis article originally appeared in Vibe.", "images": ["data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mNkYPhfDwAChwGA60e6kgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.billboard.com/assets/1593527595/images/Billboard-white.svg?14b0a264d5df641a785a", "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/01-the-weeknd-met-gala-2017-a-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/01-the-weeknd-met-gala-2017-a-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Latifah Muhammad"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7817623/the-weeknd-donates-100000-medical-center-uganda", "title": "The Weeknd Donates $100,000 to Medical Center in Uganda", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "article": {"modified_time": "2017-06-05T15:19:42-04:00", "published_time": "2017-06-05T00:58:37-04:00"}, "description": "The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Starboy\u00e2\u20ac\u009d singer donated $100,000 to the Suubi Health Center.", "og": {"description": "The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Starboy\u00e2\u20ac\u009d singer donated $100,000 to the Suubi Health Center.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/01-the-weeknd-met-gala-2017-a-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "height": 677, "width": 1024}, "title": "The Weeknd Donates $100,000 to Medical Center in Uganda | Billboard", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7817623/the-weeknd-donates-100000-medical-center-uganda", "site_name": "Billboard"}, "title": "The Weeknd Donates $100,000 to Medical Center in Uganda", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Starboy\u00e2\u20ac\u009d singer donated $100,000 to the Suubi Health Center.", "image": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/01-the-weeknd-met-gala-2017-a-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "title": "The Weeknd Donates $100,000 to Medical Center in Uganda", "site": "@billboard"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1496638717.0, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}

I wasn\u2019t in a girl group. I was in a prostitution ring. Oh & we happened to sing & be famous. While everyone who owned us made the $,\u201d she began. \u201cHow bad was it? People ask\u2014bad enough that I walked away from my dreams, my band mates & a 13 million dollar record deal. We knew we were going to be #1.\u201d\n\nJones, 33, took it one step further, calling out her \u201cden mother\u201d by writing, \u201cI want the den mother from hell to confess why another 1 of her girl group girls committed suicide? Tell the public how you mentally broke us.\u201d\n\nOf course, it wasn\u2019t long before fans suggested that the singer was referring to G.R.L. singer Simone Battle, who committed suicide in September of 2014.\n\n\u201cTo be a part of the team you must be a team player. Meaning sleep with whoever they say. If you don\u2019t they have nothing on you to leverage\u2026Yes I said leverage. Meaning after they turn you out or get you hooked on drugs they use it against you. Correct. Victimizing the victim again,\u201d continued Jones. \u201cThat\u2019s why I have so much respect for our military. I\u2019ve been through way. But my scars you can\u2019t see. At least real war is honest. Why don\u2019t we report it? Because we were all abused! I personally have been warned if I tell I will\u2026you know end up dead or no more career.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, neither a rep for the Pussycat Dolls nor Nicole Scherzinger has commented on Jones\u2019 allegations.\n\nHowever, Asia Nitollano, who was briefly a part of the group in 2007, took to Twitter to write, \u201cWho is Kaya Jones? Lol She was not apart of The Pussycat Dolls the recording group so I do not know her. If she was in the Vegas show then I know nothing about that nor have I ever heard such a thing. But judging from google she looks like she just wants her 15min of fame. (Side note\u2026 it says she\u2019s a Trump supporter\u2026 but yet she\u2019s Canadian, which means her vote doesn\u2019t count!!!! ) Same with this comment about The Pussycat Dolls; she wasn\u2019t in the group so her opinion doesn\u2019t count!!!!\u201d\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the claims surrounding the former hit-makers?

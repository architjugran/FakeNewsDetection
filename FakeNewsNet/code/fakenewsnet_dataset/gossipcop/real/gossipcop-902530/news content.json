In New Hampshire, the summit of the White Mountains registered minus 36 Saturday morning, with a wind chill of minus 94, tying for the second coldest place in the world. The National Weather Service said the temperature in Worcester, Mass., fell to minus 9 on Sunday, breaking a record of minus 5 set in 1942. Boston tied a low-temperature record set more than a century ago in 1896 of minus 2. A water main break at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport delayed flights and forced a partial terminal evacuation Sunday as the airport struggled to recover from the relentless run of bitter cold temperatures. The good news is the bone-numbing air is set to push out of the region. By Monday, Boston temperatures should return to a more seasonable low 30s.\n\n$1B awaits lottery jackpot winners\n\nMore than $1 billion in jackpots could be claimed as soon as Monday after Mega Millions and Powerball each had winners on back-to-back nights of a historic lottery weekend. Mega Millions kicked off the parade of riches Friday night when the lottery's drawing resulted in one winning ticket, sold in Florida, worth a cool $450 million. Twenty-four hours later, Powerball upped the ante. The lottery announced that one ticket sold in Merrimack, a town of 25,000 people 50 miles north of Boston, was the winner of that game's $560 million jackpot. It's the eighth-largest lottery prize in U.S. history.\n\nTrump: I'm 'a very stable genius'\n\nPresident Trump, likely responding to discussion of his mental state raised in a new tell-all book, branded himself a \"very stable genius,\" in a string of Saturday tweets, saying his two greatest assets are mental stability and being smart. The tweet burst erupted in the morning from Camp David on a day the president was meeting with top Republicans in Congress to work out a legislative agenda for 2018. Trump's tweets also followed days of brutal commentary in the wake of the publication of Michael Wolff's new book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, that quotes staffers as calling the president everything from \"moron\" to \"idiot,\" and describing him as uninformed and \"like a child.\" On Sunday, former White House strategist Steve Bannon said he intended to blame former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, not Trump's son, for a meeting in 2016 with a Russian lawyer that was characterized as \"treasonous\" in Wolff's book.\n\nAstronaut John Young dies at 87", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2018/01/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/636509479178081252-AP-75th-Annual-Golden-Globe-Awards---Arrivals.jpg", "https://media.wkyc.com/assets/WKYC/images/638ede9f-caed-4c27-8fe9-7d5cd1413099/638ede9f-caed-4c27-8fe9-7d5cd1413099_16x9.png", "https://www.wkyc.com/images/header/arrow.png", "https://media.wkyc.com/assets/ACCUWEATHER/images/dbb8d389-2d78-41a1-9ade-31907fdb369f/dbb8d389-2d78-41a1-9ade-31907fdb369f_16x9.jpg", "https://media.wkyc.com/assets/WKYC/images/f23cecae-c772-4a8e-8312-c130ef6f454d/f23cecae-c772-4a8e-8312-c130ef6f454d_16x9.jpg", "https://media.wkyc.com/assets/WZDX/images/ae154932-2250-43bb-ad5a-9c5e5459198e/ae154932-2250-43bb-ad5a-9c5e5459198e_16x9.jpg", "https://www.wkyc.com/assets/shared-images/weather-icons/wx-99_32x32.png", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2018/01/06/USATODAY/USATODAY/636508545097328046-COACH.jpg", "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5703531909001_5703506455001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "https://www.wkyc.com/assets/shared-images/icons/close-menu.svg", "https://media.wkyc.com/assets/WKYC/images/592103577/592103577_16x9.jpg", "https://www.wkyc.com/assets/shared-images/icons/facebook.svg", "https://www.wkyc.com/assets/shared-images/logos/wkyc.png", "https://www.wkyc.com/assets/shared-images/icons/twitter.svg", "https://media.wkyc.com/assets/CCT/images/f23e7ab1-452b-48b3-82bb-76e4df78bb65/f23e7ab1-452b-48b3-82bb-76e4df78bb65_16x9.jpg", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2018/01/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/636509170682646186-AP-Powerball-Jackpot.jpg", "https://media.wkyc.com/assets/WKYC/images/bdbeb613-30e3-4923-80cf-6b6107a05003/bdbeb613-30e3-4923-80cf-6b6107a05003_16x9.jpg", "https://www.wkyc.com/assets/shared-images/weather-icons/wx-99_8x8.png", "https://www.wkyc.com/assets/shared-images/backgrounds/blank.png"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2018/01/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/636509479178081252-AP-75th-Annual-Golden-Globe-Awards---Arrivals.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.wkyc.com", "title": "Here's the biggest news you missed this weekend", "meta_data": {"category": "news", "og": {"url": "https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/nation-now/heres-the-biggest-news-you-missed-this-weekend/465-cdafebdb-1a55-47d2-91df-88bbd4f7ae64", "title": "Here's the biggest news you missed this weekend", "description": "Here's the biggest news you missed this weekend", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2018/01/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/636509479178081252-AP-75th-Annual-Golden-Globe-Awards---Arrivals.jpg", "width": 1140, "height": 641}, "article": {"published_time": "1/6/2018 9:19:45 PM"}, "site_name": "wkyc.com", "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "twitter": {"title": "Here's the biggest news you missed this weekend", "image": {"src": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2018/01/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/636509479178081252-AP-75th-Annual-Golden-Globe-Awards---Arrivals.jpg"}, "card": "summary", "site": "wkyc", "description": "Here's the biggest news you missed this weekend", "domain": "www.wkyc.com"}, "viewport": "width=1170", "site": "wkyc.com", "description": "Here's the biggest news you missed this weekend", "fb": {"app_id": 145836432870387}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515253785.0, "source": "https://www.wkyc.com", "summary": ""}

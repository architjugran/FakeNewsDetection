In the dramatic new music video for her song \"Tell Me You Love Me,\" which dropped on Friday morning, the pop star and Grey's Anatomy actor Jesse Williams play an engaged couple who head for the aisle despite their tumultuous relationship.\n\nYou'll have to watch the entire video\u2014clocking in at almost seven minutes\u2014to see how the couple's relationship fares, from proposal to accusations of infidelity to exchanging rings, but it might be tough to focus on anything other than the gorgeous wedding Lovato staged for the clip. The ceremony takes place outside, on a perfectly manicured lawn in the shade of a massive tree with drooping branches. An entire robe-clad gospel choir stands on bleachers behind the wedding party, and the wedding guests sit in simple wooden chairs arranged in rows across the lawn, facing the flower-adorned arch where a pastor waits for Lovato to approach.\n\nThe \"Confident\" singer wears a white lace gown with flowing tiers and a strapless sweetheart neckline for her not-so-real nuptials. Like what you see? Lovato's wedding dress is actually Style 3659 by Lazaro and can be purchased at local Lazaro retailers for $4,290. Go get it, girl!\n\nThe (fictional) bride completed her look with dewy pink-tinted makeup, and a delicate fingertip veil. Carrying a huge bouquet of cream-colored roses, she walks down a long aisle lined on either side with clusters of white flowers. Her bridesmaids all wear slightly different styles of floor-length dresses in the same light pink shade, while Williams and his groomsmen all wear tailored gray suits.\n\nIt may not have been a real wedding, and (spoiler alert!) it may not have had the most ideal ending, but there's no denying that there's plenty of wedding inspiration to be drawn from the video.\n\nLovato teased the video\u2014and shocked fans\u2014with a series of wedding-themed posts on social media in the weeks leading up to its release. Last week, she shared a photo of her in the wedding dress she wears in the video, without any explanation. Then, on Monday, she posted a save the date for \"Demi and Jesse,\" finally revealing that the previous photo was actually tied to \"Tell Me You Love Me,\" the title track for her latest album. She continued to share photos and short clips from the video in the lead-up to its release, and then, on Friday, she posted a link to the full video. \"One of my favorite videos yet...\" she wrote.", "images": ["https://www.brides.com/thmb/Wg6tmjPWFIQi3upMkEfEk0zolfM=/1408x792/filters:fill(auto,1)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__proteus__5a217dca5e43f669f5acf8b4__169-3418a9b593ba4c4b8dbc761ef93a2ac4.jpeg", "https://:0", "https://www.brides.com/thmb/iz7NAt5MJe3aGaNp7Jw8znnPPKo=/500x350/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__proteus__5a217dca5e43f669f5acf8b4__11-ed96ed750bdb4095aad901740c16904a.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://www.brides.com/thmb/Wg6tmjPWFIQi3upMkEfEk0zolfM=/1408x792/filters:fill(auto,1)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__proteus__5a217dca5e43f669f5acf8b4__169-3418a9b593ba4c4b8dbc761ef93a2ac4.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrea Park"], "canonical_link": "https://www.brides.com/story/demi-lovato-wedding-themed-tell-me-you-love-me-music-video", "title": "Demi Lovato Is Walking Down the Aisle in a Lazaro Wedding Dress", "meta_data": {"robots": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "In the video for her new song \"Tell Me You Love Me,\" which was released on Friday, Demi Lovato gets hitched\u2014to Jesse Williams!", "emailcontenttype": "STRUCTUREDCONTENT", "emailvertical": "BRIDES", "sailthru.author": "Andrea Park", "sailthru.tags": "news,weddings-and-celebs", "article": {"section": "Brides"}, "fb": {"app_id": 785196361567992}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Brides", "url": "https://www.brides.com/story/demi-lovato-wedding-themed-tell-me-you-love-me-music-video", "title": "Demi Lovato Is Walking Down the Aisle in a Lazaro Wedding Dress", "description": "In the video for her new song \"Tell Me You Love Me,\" which was released on Friday, Demi Lovato gets hitched\u2014to Jesse Williams!", "image": "https://www.brides.com/thmb/Wg6tmjPWFIQi3upMkEfEk0zolfM=/1408x792/filters:fill(auto,1)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__proteus__5a217dca5e43f669f5acf8b4__169-3418a9b593ba4c4b8dbc761ef93a2ac4.jpeg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@Brides", "title": "Demi Lovato Is Walking Down the Aisle in a Lazaro Wedding Dress", "description": "In the video for her new song \"Tell Me You Love Me,\" which was released on Friday, Demi Lovato gets hitched\u2014to Jesse Williams!", "image": "https://www.brides.com/thmb/NZ3jp3io6BPLjLV43sECLObqu1Y=/794x794/filters:fill(auto,1)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__proteus__5a217dca5e43f669f5acf8b4__11-ed96ed750bdb4095aad901740c16904a.jpeg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#F4F4F4", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/1.73.0/icons/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/static/1.73.0/icons/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/static/1.73.0/icons/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/static/1.73.0/icons/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/static/1.73.0/icons/favicons/mstile-310x150.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.brides.com", "summary": ""}

When asked, her rep told Us, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t comment on my client\u2019s personal life.\u201d\n\nThe Harry Potter star, 27, and Knight, 37, were first spotted together in October 2015, taking in the Broadway musical Hamilton.\n\nLike Watson, who\u2019s a graduate of Brown University, Knight has an Ivy League education, graduating from Princeton in 2003 with a Bachelor\u2019s in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, he got an MBA from Columbia Business School six years ago.\n\nThe Beauty and the Beast actress was protective of their relationship, avoiding talking about her business manager boyfriend in interviews.\n\nIn February this year she told Vanity Fair that she no longer takes photos with fans, in order to avoid giving out \u201ctracking data\u201d of where she is and what she\u2019s wearing, and explained that keeping her private life under wraps is part of the way she deals with her worldwide fame.\n\n\u201cI want to be consistent: I can\u2019t talk about my boyfriend in an interview and then expect people not to take paparazzi pictures of me walking around outside my home. You can\u2019t have it both ways,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed, in Hollywood, who you\u2019re dating gets tied up into your film promotion and becomes part of the performance and the circus. I would hate anyone that I were with to feel like they were in any way part of a show or an act.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/amazon-denim-joggers-1.jpg?w=60&h=60&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/LTG-PPE-Ad-7-2020.jpg?w=900", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Watch-Moms-Like-Us.jpg?w=60&h=60&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/emmawatson.jpg?crop=0px%2C53px%2C2250px%2C1180px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-14-at-12.56.52-PM.png?w=60&h=60&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/promo-block.jpg?w=600", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CUPSHE-Womens-Shirring-Design-V-Neck-Low-Back-One-Piece-Swimsuit-1.jpg?w=60&h=60&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/emmawatson.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2250px%2C1271px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/emmawatson.jpg?crop=0px%2C53px%2C2250px%2C1180px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathy Campbell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/emma-watson-boyfriend-william-mack-knight-split/", "title": "Emma Watson, Boyfriend William 'Mack' Knight Split", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "theme-color": "#fff", "description": "Emma Watson and boyfriend William 'Mack' Knight have split after dating for nearly two years, Us Weekly can exclusively confirm \u2014 details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Emma Watson and Boyfriend William 'Mack' Knight Split", "description": "Emma Watson and boyfriend William 'Mack' Knight have split after dating for nearly two years, Us Weekly can exclusively confirm \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/emma-watson-boyfriend-william-mack-knight-split/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:15:13+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/emmawatson.jpg?crop=0px%2C53px%2C2250px%2C1180px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/emmawatson.jpg?crop=0px%2C53px%2C2250px%2C1180px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-11-24T16:44:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:15:13+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Emma Watson and boyfriend William 'Mack' Knight have split after dating for nearly two years, Us Weekly can exclusively confirm \u2014 details", "title": "Emma Watson and Boyfriend William 'Mack' Knight Split", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/emmawatson.jpg?crop=0px%2C53px%2C2250px%2C1180px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511541868.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}

{"url": "http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/dec/22/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-ted-cruz-voted-defense-cuts-rand-/", "text": "Marco Rubio portrayed fellow GOP senator and presidential hopeful Ted Cruz as all talk and no action on defense in an interview on Meet the Press.\n\n\"He talks tough on some of these issues,\" Rubio said Dec. 13. \"For example, he was going to \u2018carpet bomb\u2019 ISIS. But the only budget he's ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.\"\n\nRubio has tried to portray himself as a strong supporter of the military, while Cruz has tried to appeal to hawks as well as libertarians , who typically favor less defense spending.\n\nWe decided to fact-check Rubio\u2019s claim that Cruz voted for a budget that cut defense spending by more than the Democratic president.\n\nCruz\u2019s vote on Rand Paul\u2019s budget proposal\n\nRubio\u2019s campaign pointed to Cruz\u2019s 2013 vote in favor of a budget proposal by U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who is also running for president. Cruz was one of just 18 senators, all Republican, to vote in favor of Paul\u2019s amendment. Rubio voted against it. The measure failed.\n\nPaul\u2019s 2013 proposal emerged after the widespread budget cuts, known as the sequester, went into effect. The sequester dramatically reduced non-war defense spending during the next decade.\n\nRubio\u2019s campaign pointed to Paul\u2019s statement in his budget proposal about cutting military spending:\n\n\"This budget proposal does not simply reduce military spending, but provides directives to realign the military for the 21st century,\" Paul wrote. \"It seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military complex, including its global footprint to one that is more in line with a policy of containment.\"\n\nUnder Paul\u2019s proposal , defense appropriations would have gone from $521 billion in 2014 to $634 billion in 2023. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, meanwhile, projected $588 billion in defense appropriations in 2014 to $731 billion in 2023. That means that Paul actually increased year-over-year defense spending, though it did not keep pace with estimated projections to sustain current defense levels.\n\nWas Paul\u2019s proposal a \u2018cut\u2019 for defense?\n\nSo why did Rubio refer to Paul\u2019s budget as a \"cut\" if defense spending would rise?\n\n\"We take the budget document at its word that it cuts defense spending and seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military,\" Rubio senior adviser Joe Pounder said.\n\nBut experts questioned whether Rubio can call Paul\u2019s proposal a \"cut.\"\n\n\"Paul\u2019s defense budget was above the budget caps set in the Budget Control Act, so in that respect it was an increase (and the president\u2019s budget was an even larger increase),\" said Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"But Paul\u2019s defense budget was less than what other Republicans were proposing and what the president was proposing, so in that sense it was a cut.\"\n\nPaul\u2019s 2013 proposal for defense was well below Obama\u2019s request both at the time and now, Harrison said.\n\nChristopher Preble, at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he would not call Paul\u2019s budget a \"cut.\"\n\n\"As is typical in Washington-speak, a less-than-expected increase is often cast as a cut,\" he said. \"This is misleading.\"\n\nCruz spokesman Brian Phillips made a similar argument.\n\n\"So it sounds like Rubio is engaging in the time-honored Washington cartel tactic of budget gimmickry and is suggesting that a reduction in the rate of increase is equal to a \u2018cut\u2019 when in fact the Obama and Paul budgets spend more on defense every year,\" Phillips said. \"The fact is, in supporting the Paul budget, Cruz did not support a cut in defense spending, but a more responsible rate of increase.\"\n\nBenjamin Friedman, a defense expert at Cato, pointed to Cruz\u2019s vote in March in favor of a Rubio amendment to boost defense spending over two years rather than Paul\u2019s amendment which would have boosted it with offsets.\n\n\"This was a budget, so it doesn\u2019t make Rubio wrong, but it undermines his larger point,\" Friedman said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nRubio said that the only budget Cruz \"ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.\"\n\nRubio was referring to Cruz\u2019s vote in favor of Paul\u2019s budget proposal in 2013. But Rubio mischaracterized Paul\u2019s plan when he called it a \"cut.\" That proposal included an increase in defense spending each year from 2014 going forward a decade, although it did not keep pace with estimated projections in growth.\n\nHowever, there is a kernel of truth here in that Paul\u2019s proposal for defense was below Obama\u2019s request.\n\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.", "images": ["https://static.politifact.com/img/meter-pants-fire-th.jpg",

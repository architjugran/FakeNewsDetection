Randy Parker was admitted to Womack Army Medical Center for a broken collarbone he received when his military police vehicle hit a roadside traffic safety device, causing it to roll over. Two unnamed Army privates were injured in an unrelated incident involving a floor buffer and rubber training rifles, which they insisted were necessary to the search effort.\n\nISIS and Al Qaida have both claimed responsibility for the casualties, though their claims have yet to be verified.\n\nPentagon leadership is offering an unusual reward for information on Bergdahl\u2019s whereabouts: $25,000 or seven Guantanamo detainees, depending on the credibility of the information.\n\nOfficials are warning the public that if they see Bergdahl, they should not attempt to approach him, since he may try to surrender and become their responsibility for the next five years.", "images": ["https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/fonda3-200x150.jpg", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AMP-Logo.png", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/4742863198_fee5bcbacd_b-150x100.jpg", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/World_Trade_Center_Memorial_-_panoramio_2-200x150.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-tE3n6eADgQXgh.gif", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/4932496-e1544407509174-200x150.jpg", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/dreamstime_s_5198480-200x150.jpg", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/court-martial-360x180.jpg", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sgtmaj-200x150.jpg", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Boarding-360x270.jpeg", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/amplogo.png", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/snow-march-360x180.jpg", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/USA_PFC_BoweBergdahl_ACU.png", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/brokenglass-200x150.jpg", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/1626508-200x150.jpg", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/USA_PFC_BoweBergdahl_ACU-768x512.png", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fun-Run-360x270.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=20015427&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/wphb-cache/gravatar/0f8/0f869172b46979f2a825bd029cf1ad86x186.jpg", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/North-Korea-Launch1-360x270.jpg", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dreamstime_m_16989913-150x100.jpg", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2383179-360x270.jpg", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kim-weightlifing-360x270.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-31iz6hfFutd16.gif?labels=Domain.duffelblog_com,DomainId.36223", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Strip-Club-Fort-Irwin-200x150.jpg", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SnowLoad-e1547070574847-200x150.jpg", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/shootchesty639-200x150.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1024407104258876&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GIJoe_OriginalLineup-200x150.jpg", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/paperclip-200x150.jpg", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1026112-200x150.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/468112-200x150.jpg", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/USS-Theodore-Roosevelt-360x270.jpg", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/surrender-360x270.jpg", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Web-Logo.png", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/pt-200x150.jpg", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/wphb-cache/gravatar/0f8/0f869172b46979f2a825bd029cf1ad86x74.jpg", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/120107-D-TT977-073d-200x150.jpg", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/dreamstime_s_60567639-360x180.jpg", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/mattis-trump-200x150.jpg", "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/dreamstime_s_60567639-360x270.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.duffelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/USA_PFC_BoweBergdahl_ACU.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Posted By"], "canonical_link": "https://www.duffelblog.com/2017/10/bowe-bergdahl-wanders-off-court-martial/", "title": "Bowe Bergdahl wanders off during court-martial", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Bowe Bergdahl wanders off during court-martial", "description": "FORT BRAGG, N.C. \u2014 Bowe Bergdahl, the Army sergeant facing charges of desertion, walked out of a military courtroom during a pre-trial hearing Monday and has not been seen since approximately 10:35 AM, prompting a statewide manhunt for the missing soldier.

Joe Kennedy III (D-MA) claimed the host-city of his response to President Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address, Fall River, Massachusetts was \u201cbuilt by immigrants.\u201d\n\nFact-Check: MOSTLY FALSE\n\nWhat is now Fall River was first established in the 1600s by English settlers who were not \u201cimmigrants\u201d but colonists. A native-born family, the Bordens ran a mill in what became the town for generations before and after the American revolution. Industrialization began when Col. Joseph Durfee, a native-born Revolutionary War hero built the first factory in 1811. Later, at the end of the 19th Century a wave of immigrants swelled the town\u2019s population. Immigrants, however, never made up a majority of the population of Bristol County, where Fall River lies, even at their early 20th Century peak.", "images": ["https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/07/Biden-Economic-Speech-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/07/coronavirus-unemployed-nyc-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/06/wi/afp/30/anthony-fauci-warned-of-100-000-day-us-if-wasn-suppress-disease-pool-afp-al-e1594153797785-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/07/park-gathering-people-on-grass-unsplash-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/03/GettyImages-1198804646-200x150.jpg", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=l2Y7o1IW1810vg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/07/feb24-2019-mark-kelly-arizona-sen-gage-skidmore-flickr-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/andrew-cuomo-briefing-ap-200x150.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17674108&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/07/Bernis-Sanders-and-Joe-Biden-Associated-Press-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/AP_20100839924385-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/Supremes-200x150.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=296280873867140&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1-640x480.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/07/Biden-Trump-APcollage-stares-ap-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/07/Gettysburg-National-Park-Monuments-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/11/kaine-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/07/Mask-Shaming-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/07/GOYA-Food-Shopper-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/07/jessica_whitaker_FB-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/07/Child-Online-Class-Study-at-Home-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/08/maxine-waters-1918-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/07/NYC-Crime-Scene-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/07/107735345_10158765181515159_208743794324176588_o-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/07/Derrick-Van-Orden-Wisconsin-52020-Facebook-200x150.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-dcxh5b8qxvs6g.gif", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/07/GettyImages-1071297448-200x150.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ian Mason"], "canonical_link": "https://www.breitbart.com/live/state-union-fact-check-analysis-livewire/fact-check-no-falls-river-massachusetts-was-not-built-by-immigrants/", "title": "Fact-Check: No, Fall River, Massachusetts, Was Not \u2018Built by Immigrants\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=722987199", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.breitbart.app", "ahrefs-site-verification": "e5213d6c4a07fe85baa34006f2a9a3c977bd8f3a50fd0ab6d2aa93844e0b3303", "description": "Rep.
